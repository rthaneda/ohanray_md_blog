# The Final Collapse: Negotiations Breakdown & Starvation Crisis
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The September 16 Letter: What Enemies Are Saying

**What Bahu Reports to Peshwa:**
- Najib Khan and Suja Uddhavla negotiating terms
- Proposed boundary: **Sirhind** (not Sindhu)
- Marathas should stay away from Delhi
- These are Abdali's/Rohila's demands being communicated

**The Border Problem:**
- Sirhind is too far south
- Sirhind = Baluchistan region (barren desert)
- Loses all of Punjab
- Loses all fertile northern territory

**Suja's Role:**
- Middleman between camps
- Not 100% in Abdali's camp
- Trying to negotiate compromise
- **But his proposals still favor Abdali/Rohilas**

---

## Bahu's Counter-Position: Attaq as Boundary

**Bahu's Demand:**
- Boundary should be at **Attaq** (far to the north/west)
- Marathas should have right to protect Mughal emperor
- This is more lenient than some previous positions

**Why Attaq?**
- Raghunath Rao (earlier Peshwa) reached Attaq
- Aurangzeb went even further (toward Kabul)
- So Attaq is actually a **concession** from historical precedent
- Shows Marathas willing to compromise somewhat

**What He's Saying:**
- "I will take Attaq as boundary"
- "But I must have say in protecting Delhi"
- "No dictation of terms from outside powers"
- "These are internal Indian affairs"

---

## The Unity Message

**"Sardar Doghe Hi Bahut Saaf Aahe"**
- Rough translation: Both commanders (Shinde/Holkar) are loyal and content
- There is perfect harmony in councils
- We are united in our command structure

**What This Really Means:**
- Trying to project image of unity
- Claiming internal solidarity
- "Don't try to divide us"
- But the reality is quite different (separate deals happening)
- **This is propaganda for consumption by enemy/mediators**

---

## The Starvation Crisis: "Sarva Peech Potaatsa"

**The Core Problem:**
- "The problem we are facing is of stomach"
- Literally: No food to eat
- Broadly: Resource shortage
- **This is the existential crisis**

**Why Money Won't Solve It:**
- Even if they had money, where to buy food?
- Citizens around them are hostile
- Not enough food available in region
- Have to source from far away
- Transportation takes time and logistics
- **Money is useless without supply chains**

**The Animal Problem:**
- Animals need food too
- Don't have enough fodder
- Animals starving alongside soldiers
- This weakens cavalry and transport
- **Losing military capacity as supplies shrink**

---

## The Loan Situation: "Savkari Bandha"

**Bahu's Desperate Request:**
- Moneylenders won't give loans
- No access to credit
- Even offering attractive terms, no takers
- Why? Too risky to lend to army in field
- **Financial system has broken down**

**What Happened to Expected Revenue:**
- Tributes not arriving
- Collections delayed or non-existent
- Tax collectors not cooperating
- Government structure collapsed
- **Money promised is not materializing**

---

## The Bundela Failure

**Govind Pan Bundela's Three Tasks:**
1. Build pontoon bridge across Yamuna
2. Bring Shuja to Maratha side (alliance)
3. Provide funds and supplies

**Reality:**
- Bundela couldn't do ANY of these
- Bundela is old (60 years old—very old for era)
- Bundela has only 8,000-10,000 troops
- These are NOT battle forces (meant for tax collection)
- Not trained/equipped for major operations

**The Historical Note:**
- Few years earlier, Bundela asked Peshwa for 25,000-30,000 fighters
- Said: "I need real army because I'm in critical position"
- Peshwa couldn't spare them
- Now that war came, Bundela can't handle it

**The Tragedy:**
- If Peshwa had invested in Bundela's force
- Bundela could have done his tasks
- Would have relieved supply crisis
- Might have changed entire campaign outcome
- But strategic reserves didn't exist

---

## The Search for Hidden Treasure

**The Hope:**
- Mughal Treasury must have hidden wealth somewhere
- Maybe underground, in bunkers, secret chambers
- If found: Could fund entire campaign
- Would solve money crisis instantly

**The Effort:**
- Searched everywhere possible
- Looked in palaces, forts, buildings
- Even searched emperor's personal spaces
- **Except bedrooms** (line they wouldn't cross)
- Chose restraint over sacrilege

**The Result:**
- Found some silver plating
- Melted it down for coins
- Yielded limited cash
- Not the massive treasure hoped for
- **Emperor's treasure was already long gone** (previous rulers looted it)

---

## The Imad-ul-Mulk Silver Protest

**What Happened:**
- Silver plating melted to mint coins
- Suraj Mal protested this desecration
- Said: "You're insulting the emperor!"
- Made big noise about it

**The Hypocrisy:**
- Suraj Mal's companion Imad murdered TWO emperors
- Delhi was looted THREE times
- Imad had caused massive instability
- Now Suraj Mal complaining about silver plating?
- **Zero moral credibility**

**What This Shows:**
- Northern politics completely rotten
- No principles, pure opportunism
- Using "respect for emperor" as excuse for political maneuvering
- Everyone complicit, everyone hypocritical

---

## Bahu's Financial Accounting (September 12)

**What He's Trying:**
- Detailed accounting of money spent vs. received
- List of loans taken
- Daily expense breakdown
- Asking Peshwa: "How should I plan if this drags on?"

**The Core Question:**
- If battle resolves quickly: No problem
- If campaign drags on: How do I sustain it?
- Where will money come from?
- What should I do with existing treasury?

**His Proposal:**
- Take collections meant for Peshwa
- Use half for campaign
- Later repay with loans
- Essentially: Borrow from Peshwa's future revenue to fund present

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows he's run out of normal funding options
- Asking to raid Peshwa's revenue streams
- Desperate measures for desperate situation
- Campaign is bleeding money unsustainably

---

## The Letter Pattern

**First Phase (June/July):**
- Angry at overall situation
- Blaming others for not doing enough
- **Hard tone, not diplomatic**

**Second Phase (August):**
- Trying to placate/explain position
- Softer tone, more explanatory

**Third Phase (September):**
- Showing stress and difficulty
- Almost breakdown tone
- Request for help and guidance
- "I don't know what to do, please advise"

**The Trajectory:**
- Moves from anger → attempt at diplomacy → desperation
- Psychological breaking down
- Recognizing situation beyond his control

---

## The Manpower Situation

**What Bahu Had:**
- ~65,000 trained soldiers (core force)
- ~35,000 additional (Shinde/Holkar contingents, hired groups)
- ~25,000 noncombatants (pilgrims, old people, women, children)
- Total: ~125,000 people
- Plus uncounted animals

**Fitness for Battle:**
- Many troops never seen long-range artillery
- Many skeptical of new tactics
- Not unified command structure (multiple clan leaders)
- Morale deteriorating from hunger
- **Army degrading in combat effectiveness**

**The Noncombatant Problem:**
- They eat but don't fight
- They consume supplies
- They slow movement
- They require protection
- **Dead weight in combat situation**

---

## The Bigger Question: Why Came North?

**The Stated Reason:**
- To defend Hindustan against foreign invader
- To prevent Abdali hegemony
- Sacred duty (not selfish ambition)
- No other power could do it

**The Northern Powers' View:**
- See Marathas as exploitative
- Worry about Maratha domination
- Think Marathas will never leave
- Don't believe it's about principle
- Think it's about expansion

**The Reality:**
- Both are true and false simultaneously
- Marathas are defending principle
- Marathas are also expanding power
- Northern rulers are right to be cautious
- But they're also selfish and unhelpful

---

## The Fundamental Problem

**Bahu's Dilemma:**
- Can't fight without supplies
- Can't get supplies without money
- Can't get money without winning
- Can't win without army in good condition
- **Circular dependency with no way out**

**The Timing Curse:**
- Came in monsoon season (worst for war)
- Yamuna impassable for months
- Supply lines completely broken
- Couldn't source food locally (hostile territory)
- Couldn't wait (money running out)
- Couldn't retreat (honor and commitment)
- **Trapped by season and circumstances**

---

**Where We Left Off:** September 16, 1760. Negotiations have completely collapsed. Bundela can't deliver on any of three tasks. Supply crisis is acute and worsening daily. Treasures can't be found. Loans won't materialize. Soldiers are starving. Money is gone. And monsoon is keeping everyone trapped. Bahu has done everything possible within normal parameters. Now he's grasping for solutions. The entire campaign is approaching a crisis point. Something has to give—either they fight immediately despite conditions, or they begin slow collapse.

---

*By September, Bahu had learned the hard way that military victory isn't the same as strategic victory. Taking Delhi was easy compared to holding it. Keeping an army of 100,000+ people fed while waiting for monsoon to end proved impossible. Every day cost more than he had. Every day of waiting meant more starvation. He was trapped by geography (monsoon), trapped by logistics (no supplies), trapped by politics (can't negotiate with unreliable allies), trapped by timing (came at wrong season). He won the battle for the fort. But he was losing the war of attrition. And time was running out.*
