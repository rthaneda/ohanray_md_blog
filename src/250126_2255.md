# The Strategic Split: Bhau vs Holkar & The Caste Insult (June 1760)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Bhau's Financial Crisis: The Letter to Pune

### June 26, 1760

**Who He Wrote To:**
- **Nanasaheb Peshwa** (through Nana Fadnavis)
- Nana Fadnavis = clerk/administrator, handled correspondence

**The Main Message:**
> "We are planning to destroy or get rid of the enemy (Abdali's force). And when that happens, everything will be set right."

---

## The Revenue Problem

### The Strategy

**What Bhau Was Doing:**
> "Wherever we go, we try to get revenue from that area so that we are not putting too much strain on the treasury."

**The System:**
- Move through territory
- Extract tributes
- Get revenue from local areas
- "Taking care of our expenses as much as possible"

---

## The Leadership Vacuum: Dattaji's Death

### The Crisis

**What Happened After Dattaji Fell:**
> "Since Dattaji Shinde has fallen, there are a lot of conflicts happening within our camp."

**Why This Mattered:**
- Dattaji = **handled the northern front** for Marathas
- Since he's dead = **no clear leadership**
- **Conflicts between different commanders**
- "It's becoming difficult to manage"

**The Strife:**
- Internal disputes
- Power struggles
- Chain of command unclear
- Unity fractured

---

## The Revenue Ultimatum

### Until Dasara (Festival Date)

**The Question:**
> "Where would I get our revenues to support our force?"

**The Order:**
- Send letters to **Mamlidars** (revenue officers in different areas)
- They should provide **enough revenue** to support the army
- "This is a little bit older Marathi" (hard to translate precisely)

---

## The Moral Dilemma: Looting vs. Reputation

### The Conflict

**The Option:**
> "We could rob and put pressure on the locals to get our money or revenues, but that will not look good."

**The Concern:**
- If they harass local people
- If they pressure local societies
- If they pressure local kingdoms
- "We will not be perceived nicely"

**The Reputation Problem:**
> "We won't look like the good guys."

### The Grim Reality

**The Conclusion:**
> "But we don't have any alternative. That's why I have written this letter."

**What This Means:**
- **Will have to loot**
- Will have to pressure locals
- "Wherever we go, we have to get money"
- Only way = **force locals to pay up**
- Not stealing, but **forced extraction**

**The Letter's Purpose:**
- Asking for alternative revenue sources
- But if none = will loot anyway
- Just giving Peshwa a heads-up

---

## Suraj Mal Jat Joins the Cause

### The Meeting

**What Happened:**
- Suraj Mal Jat came to see Bhau
- Showed **willingness to join** Maratha camp
- Against Abdali's forces

**The Welcome:**
> "Bhau went out of his camp to welcome Suraj Mal Jat into their midst."

- Big ceremonial greeting
- Sign of respect
- Important alliance

---

## The Unlikely Alliance: Former Enemies Unite

### The Reconciliation

**The History:**
> "Once upon a time, Suraj Mal Jat and Imad-ul-Mulk were enemies."

**Now:**
- They've **come together**
- Joined Maratha force
- United against Abdali

**Why:**
> "Abdali was such a force that people knew they cannot stay on the fence unless they have a reason to be."

**The Calculation:**
- Both knew they had to pick a side
- Staying neutral = getting destroyed by Abdali
- Maratha side **suited them better**
- Former enemies = now allies

---

## Holkar's Hospitality: Three Months at Bharatpur

### Where They Stayed

**The Arrangement:**
> "For the last three months, Holkar and his army had taken the hospitality of Suraj Mal Jat at Bharatpur."

**What "Hospitality" Meant:**
- 15,000-20,000 soldiers had to be **fed**
- Had to be given **salary**
- Had to be **protected** (from Abdali's vicious forces)
- Bharatpur = well within Suraj Mal Jat's territory

---

## The Demoralized Northern Forces

### Why They Were Hiding

**The Situation:**
- Holkar's force **lost morale**
- Shinde's force **lost morale**
- "Both armies were beaten by Abdali forces"

**What They Were Doing:**
- Staying away from Abdali's wrath
- Doing **surgical strikes** here and there
- But **not dealing with them face-to-face**
- "Not going toe-to-toe"

**Why:**
> "They had seen the power of Abdali's force."

**The Strategy:**
- Saving their strength
- Waiting for Bhau to arrive
- Preserving forces
- Playing it safe

---

## Suraj Mal: The Political Expert

### Why He Was Valuable

**His Background:**
- Friends with **Shuja-ud-Daula** from way back
- "Friends for some long time"

**His Knowledge:**
> "Suraj Mal was very well versed in the conspiracies and politics of the North."

**Why This Mattered:**
- He was at **stone's throw from Delhi**
- More or less around Agra
- Agra = not far from Delhi
- **Understood who was on whose side**
- Knew all the conspiracy and intrigue

**For Bhau:**
- "He was very important"
- Could understand what's going on
- Could help form strategies
- Insider knowledge of northern politics

---

## The War Council: First Meeting Goes Badly

### The Setup

**When It Happened:**
> "On this occasion, the discussion about the war took place on the first day of the meeting."

**Who Was There:**
- Suraj Mal Jat
- Holkar
- Shinde
- Bhau

**The Significance:**
> "Main players from the Maratha side had gotten together."

**The Purpose:**
- Figure out how to counter Abdali's force
- Coordinate strategy
- Unite the different factions

---

## The Disagreement Emerges

### The Problem

**What Happened:**
> "When these meetings were taking place for the first time, there was some disagreements coming to the surface between the main players."

**The Core Issue:**
- Not on the same page
- Different views on **how to fight**
- "Disagreements about how to go to battle with Abdali and how to defeat his force"

---

## The Old Guard Position: Surgical Strikes

### Holkar & Suraj Mal's View

**Their Strategy:**
> "We should not have a frontal battle with Abdali. We should apply pressure on him by doing various surgical strikes and bringing him to his knees."

**What This Means:**
- **No frontal confrontation**
- Hit-and-run tactics
- Surgical strikes (Shivaji style)
- Wear them down
- Make enemy **"dilapidated and losing morale"**

**The Philosophy:**
> "Hack away at their ankles."

**The Tradition:**
> "So far, Maratha forces had never done frontal warfare."

---

## When Did Marathas Do Frontal Battles?

### The Exceptions

**Who Did Frontal Battles:**
- Shinde forces
- Malhar Rao Holkar forces

**Against Whom:**
- **Weaker enemies only**
- Rajputs
- Suraj Mal Jat (in the past)
- Small players
- Rohillas

**Against Nizam:**
- Yes, they did frontal battle
- **In the south** (Bhau's experience)
- With heavy artillery (Udgir)

**But:**
> "This was a different matter. This is a whole different ballgame and scale and enemy as well."

---

## The Experience Gap

### Who Knew Abdali?

**Bhau's Inexperience:**
> "Bhau had not had any experience of dealing with Abdali's force."

**Holkar & Shinde's Experience:**
> "Malhar Rao Holkar and Shinde army, they had dealt with these guys and they knew how ferocious these people were."

**The Knowledge:**
- They knew firsthand
- "Not any standard army"
- This was a different animal
- More dangerous than anyone else

**Their Advice:**
> "Instead of frontal attack and frontal battle, let's do a variety of peripheral surgical strikes and bring them to their knees."

---

## Bhau's Counter-Argument: The Artillery Solution

### Why He Disagreed

**His Belief:**
> "Bhau came to believe in the long-distance artillery."

**His Experience:**
- Used it against the Nizam
- "With a lot of deadly force"
- Saw how effective it was

**His Strategy:**
> "I know how to deal with it and let's not worry about surgical strikes because it will take time."

**The Problem with Surgical Strikes:**
- "We will have to do a cat and mouse game"
- Takes too long
- Abdali might leave
- Not decisive

**His Preference:**
> "Instead, I believe we should go to battle, just frontal battle."

---

## Holkar's Specific Advice: Store the Guns

### The Old Timer's Wisdom

**Who Holkar Was:**
- "An old timer"
- "A little older man also"
- Never done frontal battles
- Didn't believe in them

**His Recommendation:**
> "Keep the heavy guns in the Gwalior fort along with some other heavy artillery, heavy pieces, elephants and stuff."

**Why:**
- They'll be **safe** at Gwalior
- Fort can protect them
- Gwalior = to the south (behind them)
- Fort already there

**What to Bring Instead:**
- Take the **cavalry force**
- "Quick moving"
- Use them for surgical strikes
- Do **Gherao** (surrounding) tactics

**What to Leave Behind:**
- Cannons (too slow, too vulnerable)
- Ibrahim Khan Gardi's 10,000 **musketeer force**
- Heavy artillery
- Elephants

**His Reasoning:**
> "Holkar did not believe in it. He said just keep them there and let them not get into the battle. We don't need them."

---

## Holkar's Expertise: Master of Cavalry

### His Style

**What He Was Good At:**
> "Malhar Rao Holkar was expert in using the cavalry force in a very effective manner and quick movements."

**His Teacher:**
- Previous mentor = **Bajirao I**
- Learned cavalry tactics from the master
- Hit-and-run, quick strikes

**His Objection:**
> "This is not the way we fight battles in the north, because it's all flatland and it's not going to be good for us."

**His Inexperience:**
- Never seen big cannons in action
- "He has never been confronted with big guns"
- No evidence for himself that they work
- Can't believe in them

---

## The Fundamental Divide

### Two Philosophies Clash

**Bhau's View:**
- From the south
- Came with intention of **frontal battle**
- **Big guns** are the key
- Long-distance French cannons
- Ibrahim Khan's training and technology
- "Deep trust" in this approach

**Holkar's View:**
- Northern warfare expert
- **Not comfortable** with cannon strategy
- Flatland = different tactics needed
- Never seen it work
- Doesn't sit right with him

---

## The Caste Weapon: Bhau's Arrogance

### The Insult

**What Bhau Said:**
> "I will not listen to a Zamindar (landowner) and a shepherder."

**What This Meant:**
- **Zamindar** = just a landowner (Suraj Mal Jat)
- **Shepherder** = shepherd boy with few hundred sheep

**The Aurangzeb Echo:**
- Aurangzeb used to call Shivaji "Zamindar"
- Dismissive term
- Means: you're just a local nobody

**About Holkar Specifically:**
> "He's a shepherd man, you know, who has this few sheep, like few hundred sheep in charge of him."

**Why This Was Devastating:**
- Holkar came from a **caste that looked after sheep**
- Not warrior caste
- Not Brahmin caste
- **Lower caste**

---

## The Brahmin Superiority

### The Caste Hierarchy

**Bhau's Status:**
- **Brahmin** = high caste
- "Superior, so-called superior caste"
- Intellectual class
- Religious authority

**Holkar's Status:**
- Shepherd caste
- **Lower caste**
- "Lowly caste, you know, shepherd boy type"

**Why Bhau Weaponized This:**
> "He basically is looking down upon him as someone who doesn't understand the art of warfare as much as he does."

**The Dismissal:**
- You're not educated enough
- You're not smart enough
- You're not high-born enough
- **I won't listen to you**

---

## The Reaction: Holkar's Fury

### Who Was Insulted

**Malhar Rao:**
- Took it as an insult
- Deeply offended

**Suraj Mal Jat:**
- Also insulted (called "Zamindar")
- Also offended

### Holkar's Reported Response

**What He Said:**
> "This arrogant Brahmin is going to learn some, learn it the hard way. And that is only right."

**The Translation:**
- You're going to get what's coming to you
- You deserve to fail
- Reality will humble you
- **And I'm not going to help you**

**The Resentment:**
- Not just tactical disagreement anymore
- Now it's **personal**
- Now it's about **respect**
- Now it's about **caste hierarchy**

## Critical Insights

### 1. The Financial Strain

**The Reality:**
- Army is expensive
- No reliable revenue source
- **Must loot** or get local revenue
- But looting = bad reputation
- Catch-22 situation

**The Scale:**
- Need revenue until Dasara (festival months away)
- Massive army to feed and pay
- No treasury support from Pune
- Living off the land

### 2. The Leadership Vacuum

**Dattaji's Death:**
- Created power struggle
- Multiple commanders, no clear leader
- Conflicts within camp
- Unity breaking down

**The Problem:**
- Who's in charge in the north?
- Bhau is coming but not there yet
- Holkar? Shinde? Suraj Mal?
- Confusion and strife

### 3. The Experience vs. Confidence Divide

**Holkar & Shinde:**
- Fought Abdali's forces
- Got beaten
- **Scared** of them
- Know how dangerous they are
- Want caution

**Bhau:**
- Never fought Abdali
- Confident in artillery
- Saw it work against Nizam
- **Doesn't understand** the fear
- Thinks northern generals are cowards

### 4. The Philosophical Split

**Two Ways of War:**
- Shivaji's doctrine (hit-and-run)
- European doctrine (line battles)

**Maratha Identity:**
- Built on guerrilla warfare
- Never done massive frontal battles
- This is **new** and uncomfortable

**Bhau's Innovation:**
- Trying to modernize
- Adopt European tactics
- Use advanced weapons
- But army not trained for it

### 5. The Caste Poison

**What Should Have Been:**
- Tactical disagreement
- Debate the merits
- Find compromise
- Unite for common enemy

**What It Became:**
- Caste-based insult
- Personal attack
- Resentment and anger
- Division and mistrust

**The Consequences:**
- Holkar won't forgive this
- Suraj Mal also insulted
- Unity destroyed
- Cooperation impossible

### 6. The Reputation vs. Survival Trade-off

**The Moral Dilemma:**
- Need money desperately
- But looting makes you the bad guy
- Can't protect people if you're robbing them
- Can't win war if you're broke

**The Choice:**
- Loot and lose legitimacy
- Or don't loot and lose the war
- No good options

### 7. The Old Guard vs. New Guard

**Generational Gap:**
- Holkar = old school, experienced, cautious
- Bhau = new generation, confident, aggressive
- Neither will listen to the other
- Age and experience dismissed by youth
- Innovation dismissed by tradition

### 8. The Expertise Paradox

**Who Should Lead?**
- Holkar has northern experience
- Knows Abdali's capabilities
- But hasn't won against him
- Maybe his caution is why he's still alive?

**Bhau's Position:**
- Has won battles with artillery
- But never fought Afghans
- Confidence based on different enemy
- Will it translate?

---

## The Warning Signs

### Why This Meeting Was Ominous

**Red Flags:**
1. **Financial crisis** - looting for revenue
2. **Leadership vacuum** - Dattaji's death causing conflicts
3. **Demoralized forces** - Holkar & Shinde beaten, scared
4. **Strategic split** - fundamental disagreement on tactics
5. **Inexperience** - Bhau never fought Afghans
6. **Arrogance** - Bhau dismissing experienced advice
7. **Caste insult** - personal resentment poisoning cooperation
8. **Disunity** - everyone pulling different directions

**The Pattern:**
- Internal division
- External threat (Abdali)
- Financial pressure
- Tactical confusion
- Personal animosity
- **Recipe for disaster**

---

## The Two Paths Not Taken

### Path 1: Holkar's Way

**What If They'd Listened:**
- Store heavy guns at Gwalior
- Use cavalry for quick strikes
- Avoid frontal battle
- Play to Maratha strengths
- Wear Abdali down over time

**Problems:**
- Takes months (monsoon already here)
- Abdali might leave
- No decisive victory
- Continued financial drain
- But: might avoid total defeat

### Path 2: Compromise

**What If They'd United:**
- Bhau brings artillery as backup
- Holkar leads cavalry strikes
- Combined strategy
- Use both approaches
- Respect each other's expertise

**Why It Didn't Happen:**
- Bhau's arrogance
- Caste-based dismissal
- "Won't listen to shepherder"
- Personal insult destroyed trust
- Unity impossible after that

---

## Where We Left Off

**The Situation:**
- Main commanders finally together
- Immediate strategic disagreement
- Holkar/Suraj Mal: surgical strikes, store the guns
- Bhau: frontal battle, bring the artillery
- Bhau insults Holkar using caste weapon
- "Arrogant Brahmin" vs. "Shepherd boy"
- Holkar furious, resentful
- Unity destroyed before battle even starts

**The Question:**
- Can they repair this rift?
- Will Holkar cooperate?
- Or has the caste insult doomed them?
- What happens when personal pride meets military necessity?

---

*The war council should have been where they united against Abdali. Instead, it became where Bhau called Holkar a lowly shepherd and destroyed any chance of cooperation. The enemy wasn't just outside the camp anymore - it was inside too. Arrogance, caste prejudice, and clashing egos were about to kill more Marathas than Abdali's guns ever would.*
