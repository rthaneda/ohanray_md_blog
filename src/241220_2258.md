# Bhau's Nizam Campaign & The Cannon Regiment (October 1759 - January 1760)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Fog of War

### The Information Gap

**What Peshwa Didn't Know:**
- **A thousand miles** between Pune and Shukratal
- Dattaji enforcing siege at Shukratal
- **Unknown to Peshwa**: Ahmad Shah Abdali beginning **fifth invasion**

**The Timeline:**
- **September 1759**: Abdali took off for Punjab
- But **not known** in the Deccan
- Nanasaheb Peshwa thought: "Everything going fine"
- Thought: "Abdali busy fighting tribal wars in Afghanistan"

**The Reality:**
- Situation **rapidly changing** in north
- Nobody had understanding of how serious it was
- **Fog of war**

### Why Communication Was So Slow

**The Problem:**
- Even if people in north knew
- Would take **two weeks** to get message to Pune

**Before Nanasaheb Gets Message:**
- Two weeks minimum
- **Way too long**
- No instant messaging
- No WhatsApp

**The Danger:**
- By time you know = too late
- Can't respond quickly
- Strategic blindness

---

## The Deccan Front: Campaign Against Nizam

### Why Keep Forces at Pune

**December 1759:**
- Fighting contingent deliberately kept at Pune
- Even though:
  - Malhar Rao Holkar in Jaipur
  - Dattaji around Delhi
  - Some force in Punjab

**The Reason:**
- Always watching out for **Nizam**
- Couldn't leave Pune fully unprotected
- **Capital city**
- Nizam was **unpredictable**

**The Threat:**
- Nizam may sneak up on Pune
- Had to have protective cover
- Constant danger

---

## Sadashiv Rao Bhau: The Southern Commander

### The Appointment

**October 13, 1759:**
- Sadashiv Rao Bhau moved to war tents outside Pune
- Preparing to set out on campaign against Nizam

**Who He Is:**
- **Cousin** of Nanasaheb Peshwa
- Bajirao I = father of Nanasaheb
- Bajirao I's **brother** had a son
- That son = **Bhau**
- Called "Bhau" with affection (means brother)

**Why Him:**
- Nanasaheb **not highly inclined** to lead military campaigns himself
- Though he could
- Gave leadership of southern campaign to cousin

### The English Observation

**William Price** (English envoy in Pune since August 1759):
> "This morning, about four o'clock, Sado Bhau unexpectedly took the field, pitching his tent a little without the town. His sudden departure, it is thought, is occasioned by some advices received of the Mughals. Report says that Salavat Jung and Nizam Ali are likely to accommodate matters, and that the latter has a very powerful army."

## The Cannon Regiment Problem

### Two Artillery Chiefs: The Tension

**Muzaffar Khan:**
- **Gardi** artillery chief in Maratha army
- **Never on good terms** with Sadashiv Rao Bhau

**Who Are the Gardis:**
- Secular Maratha army recruited some Muslims
- From **Telangana** (southern province)
- These Muslims called **Gardis**
- **Specialized in cannon regiment**

**The Bad Blood:**
- Bhau had **opposed** Muzaffar Khan joining Marathas in first place
- Personality conflict
- Not about religion - Ibrahim Khan Gardi also Muslim

---

## Ibrahim Khan Gardi: The Prize Recruit

### Who He Is

**Background:**
- **Nephew** of Muzaffar Khan
- Nizam's **erstwhile artillery chief**
- Also **trained by Bussy** (the French general)

**Why Bhau Wanted Him:**
- Superior to Muzaffar Khan
- Better trained
- Better reputation
- Personal preference

### Why Marathas Needed Cannon Expertise

**The Reality:**
- Marathas **did not have expertise** within their hold
- Had to hire from outside

**The Source:**
- Muzaffar Khan: Trained by Bussy
- Ibrahim Khan Gardi: Trained by Bussy
- French general had trained several people
- From that particular area
- Happened to be Muslims

**The Evolution:**
- **Never there during Shivaji's time** or after
- Only recently understood importance
- **First time** recognizing cannon regiment necessity

---

## Why Cannon Regiment Became Essential

### The Strategic Shift

**The Old Way (Shivaji's Era):**
- Started with **protective/defensive moves**
- Guerrilla warfare (**Ghanimikawa**) very important
- Conquering lands:
  - Depend on treachery
  - Depend on Ghanimikawa
  - **Rarely engage in frontal battles**

**The New Reality:**
- Marathas becoming **established power like Mughals**
- Had to fight **one-on-one in open field**
- Transformed from small army to **huge army**
- Had to fight battles **old-fashioned way**

**The Geographic Problem:**
- In the **north = no mountains**
- Can't do Ghanimikawa
- No Sahyadri mountains
- No mountain forts
- Had to fight in **open, fertile plains**

### The Cannon Advantage

**What It Does:**
- **Softens up enemy lines** before cavalry charge
- Long-range strike capability
- Can **reach enemy** before they see you
- Makes huge difference in flat land
- **Only thing that will win wars** in north (they realized)

**In Flat Land:**
- Can't leave battle to chance
- Need **ace up your sleeve**
- Without advantage = 50-50 battle
- Cannon regiment = that ace

---

## The Famous Cannon Incident: Bussy at Charminar

### The Backstory

**What Happened:**
- Reminded them of when **Sadashiv Rao Bhau** heard about Bussy
- Bussy had **cannon regiment** in Hyderabad
- Could keep **Nizam at bay in his own capital**
- Demonstrated raw power of cannon technology

**Why They Were Impressed:**
- Such a good cannon regiment
- One man with cannons > entire Nizam army
- Technology = absolute power

**The Realization:**
- "**We need long-range cannons**"
- "**We need a force trained in it**"
- "**This is the ace we need**"
- Otherwise can't project Maratha power to north
- Otherwise stuck playing old Shivaji tactics

**The Problem:**
- Old way: Retreat to Raigarh, Rajagarh, Simhagarh when threatened
- New reality: In northern plains, **nowhere to run**
- **"You are in front of each other"**

---

## Ibrahim Khan Agrees to Join (January 1760)

### The Deal

**What He Brought:**
- **With my thousand soldiers**
- Will join Bhau
- 1,000 man cannon regiment

**The Importance:**
- These were **best trained cannon force available**
- Bussy was Frenchman
- Trained his guys for **months**
- Highly disciplined
- Long-range cannons (1-2 kilometers)

---

## The Maratha Cannon Advantage vs. Afghan Cannons

### What Afghans Had

**Small Cannons:**
- Regular small cannons
- Range: About **500 meters** or less

**Zamboorak (Camel Guns):**
- **Particular name: Zambak or Zumbak**
- Small cannons **mounted on camel backs**
- People sitting on camels riding them
- Called **Zumbak**

**How It Worked:**
- Camels move around
- **Moving cannons**
- Wherever they see enemy in front
- Launch these small cannons
- Range: At most **200 feet, 100 feet**
- Very creative

### What Marathas Had (Ibrahim Khan Gardi's Regiment)

**The Long-Range Cannons:**
- Going up to **one to two kilometers**
- Can't escape them
- **Reach you before you even see Marathas on battlefield**

**The Technological Gap:**
- Afghan cannons: 100-500 meters
- Maratha cannons: 1,000-2,000 meters
- **Massive advantage**

---

## The Fatal Flaw: Maratha Indiscipline

### The Glory Problem

**Why Cavalry/Foot Soldiers Opposed Cannons:**
- Scared of these tactics
- Scared of this style of fighting

**Why:**
> "Because they will no longer get the glory and the credits."

**The Logic:**
- Once cannons **soften up enemy ranks**
- Destroy them before cavalry charges
- Then Peshwa would say: "**You guys are no good**"
- "**My cannon force is doing the job**"
- "You're just wiping it off"
- "Just doing the final thing"

### The Lack of Discipline

**What They Wanted:**
- Go up in front
- Show how brave they are
- Show how great soldiers and fighters they are
- With swords and spears
- Traditional glory

**What This Meant:**
> "They didn't understand that it's not about credit. It's about winning the battle and being disciplined."

**The Problem:**
> "That discipline had not still gotten into the Maratha ranks."

---

## The Tactical Disaster

### What Should Happen

**Proper Sequence:**
1. Cannon force fires long-range
2. Softens enemy ranks
3. Destroys enemy formations
4. Then cavalry charges
5. Easy victory

### What Actually Happened in Battle

**The Fatal Error:**
- **Fighting force and cavalry got ahead** of cannon force
- Jumped in front of cannons

**The Consequence:**
- Then what happens?
- **They get shot by their own cannons**
- Or artillery has to **stop firing**
- Thus other army can beat them

**The Reality:**
> "That is exactly what happened on the real battlefield."

**What Could Have Been:**
- Cannon force was doing their job
- Really burning the enemies
- Afghans did not have these long-range cannons
- But weren't allowed to finish softening enemy lines

---

## Ibrahim Khan Gardi: The Hero's Story

### In the Actual Battle

**What He Did:**
- His cannons going 1-2 kilometers
- **So effective** they almost made Abdali retreat
- Creating havoc on Afghan army

**The Impact on Abdali's Army:**
- At one point, they **started fleeing battlefield**
- Towards Afghanistan
- Before they realized not totally defeated
- Really created havoc

**Abdali's Near-Retreat:**
- Abdali was in **rear guard** (always in back)
- Never in front
- Had camels, horses, all that
- Also had **30-40 wives** in very back

**The Preparation to Flee:**
- Gave orders to mount wives on horses
- Thought: "This is lost now"
- Said: "I have to **save my wives and their honor**"
- If captured by Peshwa, don't know what will happen
- Orders to leave: "**We are leaving now**"

### The Afghan General's Desperation

**What He Did:**
- General in front lines
- Saw destruction being caused by cannons
- **Got down from horse on battlefield**
- Started **eating the mud**

**Why:**
- Looked at soldiers fleeing left and right
- Total chaos
- Started appealing to them:
  - "Hey, where are you going?"
  - "**Afghanistan, Kabul is thousands of kilometers away**"
  - "**You have to stand and fight**"
  - "That is your only alternative"
  - "Please don't do this"
- Started **weeping**

**The Desperation:**
> "It became so desperate for the Afghan army."

**The Context:**
- Ibrahim Khan was **severely injured**

### The Refusal

**The Declaration:**
> "I am a Hindustani. I am the son of the soil and you are Afghan, you are Afghani and I will never, ever be joining you. Because I am a Hindustani, I am part of the family."

**The Loyalty:**

- He is my employer
- **Cannot betray him**

### The Execution

**Abdali's Reaction:**

- Immediately ordered capture
- **Slaughtered right there and then**

**The Assessment:**
> "He was loyal to the last minute when he didn't have to. But he was."

**His Personality:**
- Did a fantastic job
- Loyal beyond necessity
- Refused when he could have saved himself
- Chose honor over life

---

## The Professional vs. Unprofessional

### The Problem with Maratha Army

**The Assessment:**
> "Maratha army was unprofessional."

**Why:**
- Wanted individual glory
- Couldn't maintain discipline
- Jumped ahead of cannons
- Ruined tactical advantage
- About credit, not victory

**The Contrast:**
- Ibrahim Khan: Professional, disciplined
- Maratha cavalry: Undisciplined, glory-seeking
- One = winning strategy
- Other = self-defeating

## Critical Insights

### The Information Warfare Problem

**The Two-Week Gap:**
- Takes 2 weeks for message Pune → Delhi
- By time Peshwa knows = too late
- Can't coordinate strategy
- Can't send reinforcements in time

**The Consequence:**
- Northern and southern fronts **disconnected**
- Can't respond to Abdali invasion
- Strategic paralysis
- "Fog of war" literal and figurative

### The Technology Revolution

**Why Cannons Changed Everything:**
- Shivaji era: No cannons, guerrilla warfare worked
- Northern era: Flat land, need cannons
- 1-2 km range vs. 100-500m range = dominance
- **Can't fight modern war with old weapons**

**The Adaptation:**
- Marathas finally understood this
- Hired foreign-trained experts
- Muslims from Telangana
- Secular army = pragmatic
- Religion < expertise

### The Discipline Gap

**The Cultural Problem:**
- Maratha culture = individual heroism
- Glory in personal combat
- Sword and spear warriors
- Face-to-face honor

**The Modern Warfare:**
- Artillery = impersonal
- Long-range killing
- No individual glory
- Team coordination essential

**The Conflict:**
- Old warriors can't adapt
- Want credit for victory
- Jump ahead of cannons
- Ruin tactical advantage
- **Professional discipline hadn't entered Maratha ranks**

### Ibrahim Khan's Hindustani Identity

**The Powerful Moment:**
- Muslim man
- Trained by French general
- Working for Hindu Peshwa
- Refuses to betray employer
- Declares himself "Hindustani"

**What It Represents:**
- **Secular Indian identity**
- Loyalty to land > religion
- "Son of the soil"
- Afghan = foreigner
- "I am part of the family"

**The Irony:**
- Most loyal Maratha soldier = Muslim
- Most treacherous = Hindu kings (Madho Singh, etc.)
- Identity > religion

### The Near-Victory That Never Was

**What Almost Happened:**
- Ibrahim Khan's cannons devastating Abdali
- Afghans fleeing battlefield
- Abdali preparing to retreat
- His general eating mud and weeping
- **Marathas were winning**

**What Went Wrong:**
- Own cavalry jumped ahead
- Couldn't use cannons anymore
- Lost tactical advantage
- Indiscipline = defeat

**The Tragedy:**
- **Victory was in their hands**
- Technology advantage was there
- Leadership was there (Ibrahim Khan)
- But cultural indiscipline lost it

### The Glory vs. Victory Problem

**The Mathematics:**
- With cannons softening enemy: 80% victory chance
- Cavalry gets no glory but victory certain
- Cavalry jumps ahead: 50-50 chance
- Cavalry gets glory if they win
- But much more likely to lose

**The Choice:**
- Certain victory with no personal glory
- OR uncertain victory with personal glory
- Marathas chose personal glory
- **Lost the battle**

### The Professionalism Gap

**Ibrahim Khan:**
- Trained for months by Bussy
- Disciplined regiment
- Followed orders
- Coordinated tactics
- Professional soldier

**Maratha Cavalry:**
- Individual warriors
- Personal honor code
- Ignored overall strategy
- Wanted individual credit
- Unprofessional army

**The Lesson:**
> "This is not about credit. It's about winning the battle and being disciplined."

### The Wasted Advantage

**What Marathas Had:**
- 1-2 km range cannons (best in India)
- Trained artillery chief (Ibrahim Khan)
- 1,000 disciplined soldiers
- Technological superiority
- Winning strategy

**What They Threw Away:**
- Let cavalry ruin cannon advantage
- Lost coordination
- Turned dominance into defeat
- **Snatched defeat from jaws of victory**

---

## What's Coming

**The Setup:**
- Bhau preparing Nizam campaign (October 1759)
- Ibrahim Khan Gardi recruited with 1,000 soldiers
- Best cannon force in India now with Marathas
- But Abdali already invading in north (unknown to them)
- Two-week information gap

**The Tragedy:**
- This amazing artillery chief
- With the best cannons
- Almost defeated Abdali
- But Maratha indiscipline ruined it
- He'll be captured and killed
- Loyal to the end
- "I am a Hindustani"

**The Lesson Not Learned:**
- Professionalism > personal glory
- Discipline > individual heroism
- Modern warfare ≠ traditional combat
- But Marathas won't learn in time

---

**October 1759 - January 1760: While Bhau recruits the best artillery commander in India, while Ibrahim Khan brings 1,000 trained soldiers and French long-range cannons, while technological superiority is finally in Maratha hands - nobody in Pune knows Abdali is already in Punjab. The fog of war is literal (northern winter) and figurative (two-week message delay). And when battle finally comes, when Ibrahim Khan's cannons are winning, when Abdali himself is preparing to flee with his 40 wives, when Afghan generals are eating mud and weeping in desperation - Maratha cavalry will jump ahead for personal glory, ruin the cannon advantage, and turn certain victory into catastrophic defeat. Ibrahim Khan will be captured, will refuse to betray the Peshwa even to save his life, will declare "I am a Hindustani," and will be slaughtered for his loyalty. The best soldier in the Maratha army was a Muslim. The most treacherous were the Hindu kings. Identity over religion. Loyalty over life. But glory over victory? That's what cost them everything.**
