# Nadir Shah's Threats & The 1747 Letter to Delhi
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

## Bajirao I at Narmada: The Defensive Stance

**The Situation (1739):**
- Nadir Shah attacked Delhi, looted massively
- Wealth of Delhi was astonishing (even to Afghans)
- Question: Why didn't Bajirao defend Delhi?

**The Answer:**
- **No treaty** between Marathas & Mughals
- No obligation to defend Delhi
- Bajirao only cared about defending **Deccan**
- Stationed at **Narmada River** (southern boundary)

**The Logic:**
- "If Nadir Shah comes south of Narmada, I'll stop him"
- "But Delhi is not my concern"
- Strategic boundary defense, not empire-wide defense
- Worked: Nadir Shah never crossed Narmada
- Got too rich looting Delhi to pursue further

## Iran's Motivation: Poverty & Empire

**Why Nadir Shah Attacked India:**
- Iran was relatively impoverished
- Needed resources to build empire
- Neighboring lands had wealth
- India = treasure chest

**The Economics:**
- Agriculture in Iran = limited taxes
- Not enough to fund ambitious empire
- Afghan territories even worse (wasteland)
- India = known wealth, known resources
- Simple solution: Go take it

## Ahmad Shah Abdali: The Observer Who Learned

**Who He Was:**
- Afghan serving in Nadir Shah's army
- Watched 1739 Delhi looting
- Saw unprecedented wealth being carted away
- **Understood the lesson:** India = infinite looting opportunity

**His Learning:**
- "This is how much wealth, and they only took partial"
- "There's way more untouched"
- "When I'm free, I'll come back to this"
- Planned future invasions even while serving Nadir Shah

---

## Nadir Shah's Paranoia & Death

**What Happened After Looting:**
- Nadir Shah became paranoid back in Iran
- Thought everyone was plotting against him
- Tortured own citizens without cause
- Created atmosphere of fear

**The Result:**
- Commanders got scared
- Thought: "We might be tortured next"
- Decided: Eliminate Nadir Shah
- **Assassinated in 1747** (8 years after Delhi looting)

**The Consequence:**
- Ahmad Shah Abdali suddenly freed
- No longer bound to Nadir Shah's army
- Could return to Afghanistan
- Could pursue his India plans

## Nadir Shah's 1747 Letter to Muhammad Shah

**The Context:**
- Written 8 years after 1739 looting
- Nadir Shah still thinking about India

**The Message:**
> "It has been 8-9 years since I last came to India"
> "You are not able to defend your empire from outside forces"
> "You are still weak"
> "Even now, you can start protecting your empire"
> "If you need my help, I am ready"

**The Threat:**
- Implied: "People like me are waiting to raid you"
- "When will you protect yourself?"
- "Better defend now before it's too late"
- Semi-mocking tone about Mughal weakness

**The Strategic Message:**
- Delhi remains vulnerable
- No effective defense system
- Mughal Empire is paper tiger
- Raiders (like Nadir Shah) will keep coming
- You should prepare, or I will come again

---

## The Real Problem: Mughal Weakness

**What Nadir Shah Understood:**
- Mughals weren't recovering
- Getting weaker, not stronger
- No army could stop raiders
- Essentially undefendable

**The Warning Was Accurate:**
- Delhi would be attacked again (by Abdali)
- Muhammad Shah couldn't defend it
- Mughal position was terminal
- Just matter of time until next raid

**1739:** Watches Delhi looting, learns the lesson

**1747:** Nadir Shah assassinated, Abdali freed

**Next decades:** Builds Afghan kingdom, plans return to India

## Critical Insights

### 1. Boundary Defense Strategy
Bajirao at Narmada = perfect defensive positioning. Doesn't need to defend all of India, just his boundary. Works perfectly when enemy doesn't cross it.

### 2. The Predator's Learning
Abdali watched and learned. Information more valuable than loot in this case. One looting trip = template for future invasions.

### 3. The Warning Ignored
Nadir Shah was warning Muhammad Shah about future threats. Muhammad Shah couldn't do anything about it. Mughal Empire was terminal—no recovery possible.

### 4. Paranoia & Assassination
Nadir Shah's paranoia in Iran = what caused his assassination. Created threat that freed Abdali to pursue own ambitions.

### 5. The Cycle Continues
Pattern: Loot → Learn → Plan → Return. Abdali saw what Nadir did and thought: "I can do this too, and better, and repeatedly."

## Key Quotes

> "If Nadir Shah comes down south of Narmada, I will protect it. But I have no business defending Delhi."

> "Ahmad Shah Abdali understood how much wealth there was to be gained by attacking India"

> "It has been 8-9 years since I last came to India. You are not able to defend your empire."

> "People like me are waiting to raid you. When will you protect yourself?"

**Where We Left Off:** Bajirao has strategically positioned at Narmada to protect Deccan. Nadir Shah looted Delhi but didn't go further south. Ahmad Shah Abdali learned the lesson and started planning. Nadir Shah's letter warned Muhammad Shah (but too late for him to do anything). 8 years later, Nadir Shah is dead, Abdali is free, and a new threat is forming. The Marathas and Afghans will eventually collide. And it will happen at Panipat.

*Nadir Shah's 1747 letter was basically saying: "Your empire is weak. Raiders will keep coming. Better protect yourself." Muhammad Shah got the message but couldn't do anything about it. His armies were weak, his treasury was empty, his confidence was gone. Within 14 years, Abdali would attack and Marathas would fight him at Panipat. But that letter was the warning: Delhi is vulnerable, and predators know it.*
