# Suja Joins Abdali: The Dramatic Persuasion (July 1760)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Najib Khan's Opening Argument

**The Accusation:**
> "So he basically said this is pure deceit, this letter of Sadashiro Bhau to Mr. Sujaut Dola. And their real plan, Maratha plan, is to control the entire India and end the rule of Islamic rule in India."

**The Framing:**
- Not between Afghans and rest of India
- Not between Afghans and indigenous powers
- About **protecting Muslims in India**
- Choosing either **Muslim side** or **Kafir side**

**The Challenge:**
> "So you have to choose whichever you want."
- Very **black and white** to Najib
- No middle ground
- No neutrality possible (in his view)

---

## Suja's Initial Response: Neutrality

**The Reality Check:**
> "Even after all this commentary, Suja decided to remain neutral."

**Why Suja Couldn't Deny:**
> "Suja could not say that Islam is not in danger."
- The argument had merit
- Evidence was real
- But still chose neutrality initially

---

## Suja's Concerns About Abdali

**The Historical Grudge:**
- Suja thought Abdali will take **revenge** for defeat at **Manipur**
- His **father** had fought that battle
- **Defeated Abdali**

**The Sectarian Divide:**
- Their sects were different
- Suja: **Shia**
- Abdali: **Sunni**
- He still had that difference in mind

**The Conclusion:**
> "So even though he really shared his heartfelt feelings and emotions by Najib, it was of limited significance."

---

## Najib Khan's DRAMATIC Escalation

### The Personal Guarantee

**What Najib Said About Abdali:**
> "What is the interest that Suja has in Abdali's army? So Shah means he's referring to Abdali."

**The Threat Protection:**
> "If Abdali were to look at you in a hostile manner, I will take out his eyes. And if I didn't do that, I would not basically have my father's name attached to me. I would be totally destroyed. I will renounce my family and everything."

**The Message:**
- Don't be worried about bad blood
- Between Abdali and you
- I personally guarantee your safety
- With my own life and honor

### The Ultimate Pressure

**The Dagger Offer:**
> "If somebody else were to have come from Abdali as a messenger, it would have been okay if you didn't agree. But now that I have come, here is my dagger."

**The Gesture:**
- Gives Suja his **dagger**
- Says: "Here is my **neck**"
- "You can simply behead me"
- **"I can't return unsuccessfully"**

**The Written Promise:**
> "If you were to slit my throat, I would give you in writing that you are not responsible for killing me."

**The Implication:**
- Going **all out** to convince Suja
- Putting his life on the line
- Can't go back to Abdali empty-handed
- Ultimate pressure tactic

---

## The Deciding Factor: Fear of Being Belittled

### The Real Reason Suja Joined

**What Changed His Mind:**
> "Mr. Suja Uddula became restless."

**The Deliberation:**
- He deliberated with **advisors** for few days
- Finally, **July 1760**
- Decided to join side of **Abdali**

### The Snide Remarks Problem

**The Explanation:**
> "So he finally came to the conclusion that instead of listening to Abdali's when somebody kind of is talking about you in a very negative manner, instead of listening to these kind of very bad commentary about himself, he said, it's better to fight with Marathas than listening to Abdali's slight comments."

**What Are "Slight Comments":**
- **Snide remarks**
- Targeting someone
- But not said in direct way
- Example: "Some people always delayed in doing things so they cannot be trusted"
- Indirect insult

**Suja's Fear:**
- If he remained **neutral**
- Abdali would comment in way that makes him look **weak**
- Someone who doesn't stand up for Muslims
- Constant belittling
- Indirect accusations

**The Choice:**
> "Instead of putting up with that, it's better to fight with Marathas."

**The Psychology:**
> "So he didn't want to be morally inferior to Abdali. Or belittled."

---

## Kashi Raj Pandit's Analysis

**Who He Was:**
- Employed by **Suja-ud-Daula**
- Had commentary on Suja's decision

### His Assessment

**The Conclusion:**
> "To join Maratha alliance is very risky. And not the right thing to do."

**The Risks:**
- Risky business to go on that side
- Wrong decision

### The Reasoning

**The Arrogance Problem:**
> "It will be arrogant to reject the hand of friendship extended by Abdali by sending such a very high, high standing person like Najib Khan be taken as arrogance."

**The Rohilla Problem:**
- Abdali is one thing
- But the **Rohillas** also will take it as **insult**
- Najib Khan was a **Rohilla**
- Other Rohilla warriors and people
- They also would take it as insult

**The Asymmetry:**
- Najib Khan was **high standing officer** sent by Abdali
- Marathas did **not** have high powered person visiting him
- Lopsided
- One side sent top emissary
- Other side: nothing comparable

### The Danger Either Way

**The Risk:**
> "But if anybody wins one of the parties, that danger was there because if Abdali wins, the Marathas will take revenge one day or the other and vice versa."

**The Calculation:**
- Has to be careful even in joining Abdali
- Whichever side loses
- Will want revenge later
- No safe choice

**But:**
> "He decided to listen to Najib Khan and he made plans to meet with Abdali."

## Kashi Raj Pandit: The Hindu Advisor

**The Note:**
- Kashi Raj Pandit was likely **Hindu**
- But had some role in Suja's fold
- Employed by Muslim ruler
- Shows diversity of advisors

---

## The Meeting with Abdali

### The Journey

**What Suja Did:**
- Left behind **most of his army** back in kingdom
- For defense in case something goes wrong
- But took **4,000 military soldiers**
- Came into Abdali's tent

**The Location:**
- **Anupshar**
- **100 kilometers** away from where he was

### The Welcome

**Who Welcomed Him:**
- **Shah Wali Khan** welcomed him
- Shah Wali Khan was **Wazir of Afghanistan**

**The Announcement:**
- Abdali announced that Mr. Suja-ud-Daula is **Wazir of the Mughal Empire**
- As promised
- Didn't even worry about anybody else

**The Timing:**
- Declaring it **ahead of time**
- Assuming they would win
- Before even conquering Delhi

---

## Suja's Response: This Is Theatre

### The Objection

**What Suja Said:**
> "There is nobody occupying the seat of power in Delhi. So don't make me ashamed by announcing me Wazir ahead of time because there is no emperor in Delhi."

**The Implication:**
- Or: no **legitimate** emperor
- Someone is sitting there
- But Suja doesn't recognize him

**Suja's Point:**
> "This announcement has no meaning, sir."

**The Reality:**
> "So Abdali is playing a theatre in front of him."

### Suja's Counter-Proposal

**What He Said:**
> "In fact Abdali should be sitting on the throne of Delhi, then he will accept the Wazir position."

**The Parallel:**
- Which is what **Suraj Mal Jat** also had said
- "You must sit on the throne in Delhi"
- Most people saying same thing

---

## The Muharram Crisis: One Month Later

### The Real Test

**The Timing:**
> "After a month, that was the real test of Abdali's promise."

### What Is Muharram?

**The Background:**
- Commemoration of **sufferings** of Prophet Muhammad's relatives
- His grandchildren
- After Muhammad died
- There was question of succession
- Who represents worldwide Muslims?

**The Succession Crisis:**
- One group wanted Muhammad's **family members** to be leaders
- Another group said: "We are the leaders"
- Family members were **captured**
- In Syria (or somewhere)
- By people in charge of Muslim throne
- They were subjected to lot of **suffering**
- Finally **killed**

**The Commemoration:**
- That day and suffering is commemorated in **Shia world**
- They don't like how these people suffered
- How they were killed in brutal manner
- So they commemorate

### The Ritual

**What Happens:**
- They **relive that suffering**
- Shia young people: **bare chested**
- Nothing on body
- Take different **knives**
- Put it on their body everywhere
- **Slash themselves** repeatedly
- Procession goes through street
- Bodies full of **blood**
- Looks like they're **torturing themselves**
- Thousands of young men like that

**The Nature:**
> "So that is the celebration of the suffering."

### The Sectarian Divide

**Why This Matters:**
- This is **not a Sunni thing**
- Sunnis don't believe in it
- Sunnis represent the other group of leaders
- Who came after Muhammad's death
- Who didn't believe in family members being leaders

**The Split:**
- One sect: **offsprings of Muhammad** should be leaders
- Other sect: "We are the ones who are leaders"
- Battle happened between two groups
- **Forever separated**
- This is why Shia vs Sunni exists

---

## The 200 Troublemakers Incident

### What Happened

**The Problem:**
> "Some people started some funny business in Shuja's tent."

**Who:**
- **200 troublemakers** from Abdali soldiers
- Giving trouble to **Shia soldiers** of Suja-ud-Daula
- During Muharram celebration

### Abdali's Response

**The Punishment:**
- Suja asked them to be **captured**
- Said: "I'm going to push through a kind of **stick through your nose**"
- **Each one** of the 200 people
- As punishment for creating trouble

**Why Abdali Allowed This:**
> "Because Abdali would have none of this. He wanted Shuja on his side, no matter what."

**The Message:**
- Sending message to his troops
- Don't even **think** about upsetting this guy
- Normally wouldn't do it
- But this time he was **angry**

---

## The Cultural Incompatibility Problem

### The Hindu Soldiers Issue

**The Situation:**
> "So that was a trouble for Abdali. Because, you know, I mean, these are, first of all, Hindu soldiers in Shuja's army."

**What They Did:**
- Sometimes used to be **bare minimum clothes**
- Used to go around like that
- **Naga soldiers** (a specific group)

**The Cultural Difference:**
- Creates friction with Abdali's army
- Cultural difference
- They **despise each other**
- Another thing to get mad about

### The Compromise

**What Happened:**
> "He took exception to these naked Nag soldiers in Shuja's army. And that was implemented."

**The Meaning:**
- Suja immediately told his **Naga troops**
- You have to **put some clothes on**
- So Afghan troops are not offended

**Suja's Willingness:**
- Willing to **compromise**
- Accommodate Afghan sensibilities
- To keep alliance together

---

## The Wobbly Unity

**The Result:**
> "Because Mr. Shuja Udhola took steps to stop this, the kind of really wobbly unity between Shuja Udhola and Abdali somehow stayed put. It didn't collapse."

**What It Shows:**
- They managed to get along
- But barely
- Unity was **wobbly**
- Constant friction
- Required active management

---

## Suja Feels Trapped

### Can't Leave Abdali's Camp

**The Control:**
> "Abdali had kept good control over his troops. But Shuja Udhola thought it was unsafe to get out of Abdali's tent city."

**The Situation:**
- After he came to meet Abdali
- Stayed put in that **campus**
- Had 4,000 troops
- Didn't go anywhere else
- Just staying in same area

**Why:**
- Even though there were **disturbances**
- Two armies had some **struggles**
- Thought it was **risky** to quit that campus
- Go somewhere else

**The Reason:**
> "Because then Abdali would say, what is happening with this guy? Why is he going away? He wants him within his eyesight."

### Can't Go Back

**The Other Reason:**
> "One another reason he didn't want to go back is because he had come voluntarily and he didn't want to show that he is going back on his word."

**The Trap:**
- Now he was **stuck**
- What he saw: culture incompatible
- Shia troops vs Afghan troops
- Naga troops vs Afghan troops
- **Deficit of trust**
- But now **in too deep**
- Cannot go anywhere

---

## Suja's Hope: Peace Without War

### The Best Outcome

**What He Believed:**
> "He basically came around to believe that if this whole issue can be resolved without any warfare but by some kind of a truce or some kind of exchange of ideas and non-violently if this issue can be resolved between Marathas and Afghans, then that will be the best outcome for him."

**Why:**
- He was **not on the Afghan side at all**
- Didn't want to bet his little empire/kingdom on their victory
- He was on **neither side**
- Didn't want to take any side
- But was **forced** to take Abdali's side

**The Reasoning:**
- Had no other way
- Had to go there
- Otherwise would fare very badly
- Both options were bad
- Chose **less bad option**

### The Realization

**After Several Weeks:**
- In that campus
- Realized: **"This is looking bad"**
- Now trying to see how he can **survive this**

**The Only Good Outcome:**
- No war happens between two sides
- Peace treaty
- Resolve differences **non-violently**
- Everybody goes home
- That's the only way he's feeling better

## Major Themes

### 1. The Dagger Diplomacy

**Najib's Escalation:**
- Started with arguments (didn't work)
- Escalated to personal guarantee
- Finally: **dagger offer**
- "Here's my neck, behead me"
- "I can't return unsuccessfully"

**The Pressure:**
- Not just persuasion
- **Coercion** through guilt
- Put Suja in impossible position
- How can you refuse when someone offers their life?

**The Message:**
- This is that important
- I'm putting everything on line
- You must say yes
- No middle ground

### 2. The Belittlement Fear

**The Real Motivation:**
> "Instead of putting up with that, it's better to fight with Marathas."

**What This Shows:**
- Not convinced by "Islam in danger" alone
- Not won over by promises
- **Fear of being mocked** tipped scales
- Indirect insults
- Snide remarks about not being man enough
- About not defending Muslims

**The Psychology:**
- Pride
- Honor
- Public perception
- Can't be seen as weak
- Can't be belittled by Abdali

### 3. The Theatre of Power

**Abdali's Tactics:**
- Declares Suja **Wazir** immediately
- Before even winning
- "Playing theatre"
- Shows others: I keep my promises
- Propaganda value

**Suja's Response:**

- Sees through it
- But can't refuse

### 4. The Sectarian Tinderbox

**The Muharram Crisis:**
- Shia celebration
- Sunnis offended

- Stick through nose
- All 200 people
- Extreme measure
- Shows desperation to keep Suja

### 5. The Cultural Incompatibility

**The Issues:**
1. Shia vs Sunni rituals
2. Naga soldiers (barely clothed)
3. Afghan sensibilities offended
4. Constant friction
5. Despise each other

**The Compromise:**
- Naga soldiers must wear clothes
- Suja willing to accommodate
- But shows underlying tension
- "Wobbly unity"

### 6. The Trapped Ally

**Suja's Situation:**
- Came voluntarily
- But can't leave
- Under Abdali's watchful eye
- "Wants him within his eyesight"
- Stuck in camp
- Can't go back (would show weakness)

- No way out

### 7. The Peace Fantasy

- Non-violent resolution

**The Reality:**
- Completely unrealistic
- Both sides committed
- Too much at stake
- Can't back down now
- But Suja desperately hoping

**The Desperation:**

- Whichever side loses = his ruin
- Winner might not protect him later
- Lose-lose

### 8. The Hindu Advisor

**Kashi Raj Pandit:**
- Hindu
- Advising Muslim ruler
- On whether to join Muslim coalition
- Against Hindu power

**What It Shows:**
- Not purely religious
- Political calculations
- Advisors diverse
- Religion not only factor

**His Analysis:**
- Coldly political
- Weighing risks
- Considering insults
- Practical, not ideological

### 9. The Asymmetric Courtship

**What Najib Pointed Out:**
- Abdali sent **Najib Khan** (high-ranking)
- Marathas sent... nothing comparable
- Lopsided attention
- Shows who wants you more

**The Message:**
- Abdali values you
- Marathas don't
- Clear difference in effort
- Should matter in decision

### 10. The Promise Test

**Abdali's Punishments:**
- 200 troublemakers threatened
- Protecting Suja from own troops
- Showing: I keep my promises
- You're safe with me

**The Message:**
- When I guarantee safety
- I mean it
- Will turn on my own people
- To protect you

**But:**
- Also shows how much he needs Suja
- Desperate to keep him
- Willing to go to extremes
- Suja sees this too

---

## Critical Insights

### The Dagger as Ultimate Pressure

**What Najib Did:**
- Not just persuasion
- **Emotional blackmail**
- Put his life on line
- Made it personal
- "If you refuse, you kill me"

**Why It Worked:**
- Suja couldn't just say no
- Would be rejecting sacred bond
- Would be killing messenger
- Makes him guilty
- No graceful way out

**The Genius:**
- Turned political calculation
- Into personal obligation
- From "what's best for me"
- To "can't let this man die"

### The Snide Remarks Calculation

**The Fear:**
- Not about actual danger
- About **reputation damage**
- Abdali making indirect comments
- About cowardice
- About not defending Muslims
- Constant belittlement

**Why This Tipped It:**
- Could handle threats
- Could handle risks
- Couldn't handle **mockery**
- Pride > safety
- Honor > calculation

**The Insight:**
- Najib understood this
- Used "Islam in danger" to set up
- Then pushed pride button
- Perfect two-punch

### The Theatre That Backfires

**Abdali's Mistake:**
- Declares Suja Wazir immediately
- Thinks it shows trust
- Thinks it's impressive

**Suja's Reaction:**
- Sees through it
- "This is meaningless"
- "No emperor to be wazir of"
- Doesn't fall for it

**What It Shows:**
- Suja is shrewd
- Not easily fooled
- Sees propaganda for what it is
- But trapped anyway

### The Muharram Time Bomb

**Why This Crisis Matters:**
- One month into alliance
- Already nearly collapsed
- Over religious ritual
- Shows underlying incompatibility

**The Implications:**
- This alliance is **fragile**
- Any moment could break
- Built on necessity, not compatibility
- Abdali knows it
- Had to be extremely harsh
- To keep it together

### The Cultural Horror Show

**The Naga Soldiers:**
- Barely clothed
- Normal for them
- Offensive to Afghans
- Source of constant friction

**The Compromise:**
- Suja orders them to dress
- Accommodating Afghan sensibilities
- Giving up own culture
- To keep peace

**What It Reveals:**
- Suja already compromising
- Giving ground
- Losing autonomy
- This is how it starts

### The Trapped Ally Psychology

**The Progression:**
1. Come voluntarily (sort of - under pressure)
2. Can't leave (Abdali watching)
3. Can't go back (would show weakness)
4. Realize you're trapped
5. Hope for miracle (peace)

**The Desperation:**
- Only hope: war doesn't happen
- Completely unrealistic
- But clinging to it
- Because all other outcomes = disaster

### The Losing Game

**Suja's Calculation:**
- If Abdali wins: Marathas revenge later
- If Marathas win: Abdali's forces revenge
- If stays neutral: both sides angry
- If joins Marathas: too risky
- If joins Abdali: currently stuck

**The Reality:**
- No good options
- Every choice has costs
- Chose least bad
- Now suffering consequences
- Hoping for impossibility (peace)

### The Wobbly Unity

**What "Wobbly" Means:**
- Constant crises
- Barely held together
- Required active management
- Could fall apart any time
- Built on weak foundation

**The Components:**
1. Sectarian divide (Shia-Sunni)
2. Cultural incompatibility
3. Mutual distrust
4. Forced alliance
5. Neither wants it
6. Both need it

**The Survival:**
- Only survives because
- Abdali desperate to keep Suja
- Willing to punish own troops
- Willing to make extreme threats
- Without that: would collapse

---

## What's Coming

**The Situation:**
- Suja joined Abdali (July 1760)
- Feeling trapped
- Hoping for peace (won't happen)
- Cultural tensions constant
- Alliance fragile
- But he's stuck

**The Questions:**
1. Will this alliance hold?
2. How long can Suja stay trapped?
3. Will cultural tensions explode?
4. Can he escape if things go bad?
5. What happens when war actually starts?

**The Stakes:**
- Committed now
- Can't back out
- Whichever side loses = his ruin
- Even if his side wins
- Other side wants revenge
- No good outcome
- Just hoping it doesn't come to war
- But it will

---

**July 1760: Najib Khan puts a dagger in Suja's hands and offers his neck. "If you refuse, behead me. I can't return to Abdali empty-handed." After days of deliberation, Suja joins not because he believes "Islam is in danger" - he joins because he can't stand the thought of Abdali making snide remarks about him, indirect insults about not being man enough to defend Muslims, being belittled at every gathering. Pride tips the scales. He travels 100km with 4,000 troops. Abdali declares him Wazir immediately - pure theatre, since there's no real emperor to be wazir of. One month later, during Muharram, 200 Sunni troublemakers harass Suja's Shia soldiers. Abdali threatens to push sticks through all their noses. The message: I'll turn on my own people to protect you. But Suja sees the truth. His bare-chested Naga soldiers offend the Afghans. Constant cultural friction. He can't leave Abdali's camp - too risky. He can't go back - would show weakness. He's trapped. And he's desperately clinging to one fantasy: maybe this can all be resolved peacefully, without war, and everyone can just go home. It won't happen. But it's the only hope he has left.**
