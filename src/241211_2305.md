# Peshwa's Strategic Instructions & The Fatal River-Crossing Problem (Early-Mid 1759)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Nana Saheb's Clear Strategic Vision

### The Peshwa's Instructions

**From Pune, Nana Saheb gave precise directions:**
- Defined allies, adversaries, and demands lucidly
- Laid out broad principles of policy
- Gave Dattaji clear strategic framework

**The Title:**
- Peshwa considered Dattaji: **"Ishwaratha Shipai"** = "God's Soldier"
- Righteous and powerful
- Trustworthy executor of divine/righteous mission

### The Assumptions

**These plans were plausible in early 1759 because:**

1. **No opposition from Indian princes** to Marathas
2. **Abdali was embroiled in civil war** in Afghanistan

**The Problem:**
> "If those assumptions were not to be true, then there is a problem."

**The Fatal Flaw:**
- Everything depended on Abdali staying busy in Afghanistan
- If he resolved his internal problems and came to India...
- The entire strategy would collapse

---

## The Najeeb Khan Warning (March-May 1759)

### Peshwa's Repeated Warnings

**Letter of 21 March 1759:**

> "You have written that Najeeb would pay 30 lakhs to be made the Mir Bakshi of the Mughals. However, he is very treacherous. If he settles in Delhi, it is like **Abdali being in Delhi**."

**The Snake Metaphor:**
> "Advancing him is like **feeding a cobra with milk**. Crush him."

**Letter of 2 May 1759:**
- Nana Saheb calls Najeeb Khan a **"crook"**
- Labels him **"half Abdali"**
- Basically Abdali's proxy in India

### Over Six Months of Warnings

**The Pattern:**
- Peshwa warned Dattaji repeatedly
- Every letter: "Crush Najeeb Khan"
- Recognized his treacherous nature
- Knew he could never be trusted

### Dattaji's Proposal (Rejected)

**What Dattaji Wanted:**
- Offer Najeeb the **Mir Bakshi** post in Delhi
- Try to co-opt him into Maratha system
- Use his skills for Maratha benefit

**Peshwa's Response:**
- Absolutely NOT
- Cannot be trusted under any circumstances
- Will betray at first opportunity
- Must be eliminated, not promoted

**The Insight:**
> "Peshwa was prescient. Dattaji probably didn't understand because he was relatively new to the politics of the North."

## The Deal with Shuja-ud-Daula

### The Proposed Exchange

**What Peshwa Wanted from Shuja:**

1. **The Three Holy Cities:**
   - **Allahabad** (Prayagraj)
   - **Kashi** (Varanasi)  
   - **Mathura**

2. **50 Lakh Rupees**

**What Marathas Would Give:**
- Back Shuja-ud-Daula as **Imperial Wazir**
- Give him power and legitimacy
- Support against his enemies

### Why the Holy Cities Mattered

**Religious Significance:**
- These are the **holiest of holy sites** for Hindus
- Even for Marathas from Maharashtra, these three sites are paramount
- Had been under Islamic rule for centuries
- **Sore point** for Hindu identity

**Shivaji's Legacy:**
> "Marathas have the character of a Hindu kingdom given by Shivaji."

**Pride Factor:**
- Taking back these holy sites = symbolic victory
- Reclaiming Hindu sacred geography
- Fulfilling Hindu nationalist aspirations

### The Economic Reality

**Why Shuja Didn't Want to Give Them Up:**

*The Religious Economy:*
- Hindu pilgrimage sites = massive economic hubs
- Constant flow of visitors spending money
- Small businesses thriving around temples
- Huge donation revenues
- **"The economy of these religious places was humongous"**

*The Tax Revenue:*
- Subedar collected taxes from all this economic activity
- Enormous steady income stream
- "Finally it comes down to money"

**Shuja's Dilemma:**
- Wanted to be Wazir (needed Maratha support)
- But didn't want to give up his richest territories
- **Procrastinated** on this point

## Punjab: The Five Rivers

### Geographic Lesson

**The Five Rivers of Punjab:**
1. Sutlej
2. Beas
3. Ravi
4. Chenab
5. Jhelum

**All Five Meet:**
- Flow into the **Sindhu** (Indus) River
- Sindhu = so huge it's called "Nod" (masculine), not "Nadi" (feminine)
- Creates incredibly fertile region
- "So much water that you can't imagine"

**Just Like Doab:**
- Doab = land between Ganga and Yamuna
- Very fertile region between two rivers
- Punjab = same concept but five rivers

---

## The Chiefs Ignored Peshwa's Warnings

### Malhar Rao's Interference (Again)

**Why Najeeb Survived:**
> "The Peshwa recognized Najeeb Khan's potential for mischief, but his chiefs had let him be."

**Which Chief?**
- **Malhar Rao Holkar**
- Deliberately ignored Najeeb's mischiefs
- Ignored his ambitions and treachery
- Protected him as adopted son

**The Cynical Career Logic:**
- "He is the reason we have a job"
- Keep the problem alive = keep your position

**But Also Genuine:**
- Mutual father-son feeling
- Honest about relationship (not hypocritical)
- Real emotional bond

---

## Raghunath Rao's Experience

### He Knew the Danger

**Raghunath Rao Warned Dattaji:**
- Wrote to protect the north from Abdali's invasion
- He had **seen the devastation** Abdali could wreak
- Met Abdali's divisions during first northern tour
- **Tasted the fury** of Abdali's army

**His Regret:**
> "Raghunath Rao did understand the risk."

**Why This Mattered:**
- Raghunath Rao had EXPERIENCE with Abdali
- Knew firsthand how dangerous he was
- Tried to warn Dattaji
- But Dattaji had different priorities

---

## Dattaji's Fatal Decision

### Discarding the Peshwa's Warning

**The Choice:**
> "In the circumstances, Dattaji discarded the Peshwa's warning to crush Najeeb Khan, deciding to use him instead."

**Why:**
- Focused on securing Punjab first
- Wanted to reach **Patna** before monsoons
- Plan: Secure Punjab → Cross Ganga → Reach Bihar/Bengal
- Needed to move FAST

**The Overstretch:**
- Marathas spreading themselves too thin
- Assumed Abdali would stay busy in Afghanistan
- But if Abdali finished his internal challenges?
- He'd come back to India and focus on Punjab first

**The Distance Problem:**
- If Dattaji is in Bihar/Bengal (far east)
- And Abdali attacks Punjab (far west)
- Dattaji is at least 3-4-5 days away, maybe a week
- No prominent commander left in Punjab itself
- Despite appointments, needed someone of Dattaji's caliber

---

## The River-Crossing Problem

### Why Dattaji Needed Najeeb

**The Technical Challenge:**
- To go east, must cross **mighty rivers**
- Marathas had NO technique to cross rivers with armies
- This was critical engineering capability they lacked

**Najeeb's Expertise:**
- Developed **pontoon bridge technique**
- Ties boats together one to another
- Creates bridge-like structure across river
- Army, horses, cannons can cross

**The Snake's Promise:**
- Najeeb kept promising: "Yes, I will do it. I will help you."
- But he was lying the whole time
- Knew if he taught Marathas this technique:
  - Marathas become highly mobile
  - Najeeb becomes unnecessary
  - Marathas would eliminate him

**Dattaji's Gullibility:**
> "The Dattaji was relatively gullible. He didn't understand that this guy can never be trusted."

**The Trap:**
- Najeeb promised help repeatedly
- Always had excuse: "I'm busy here, busy there"
- "No problem, I'm at your service"
- Dattaji believed him
- Couldn't read people properly

### Following Malhar Rao's Bad Advice

**Dattaji's Plan:**
- Follow Malhar Rao's advice to cultivate friendship with Najeeb
- Use his help to cross the Ganga
- Pass towards Awadh
- From Awadh → Bihar → Bengal

**The Geographic Necessity:**
- Unless Ganga is crossed, cannot go to Awadh
- From Awadh must go to Bihar
- Then cross into Bengal (extreme east)
- Sequential progression required

**The Choice:**
- Instead of killing Najeeb (as Peshwa ordered)
- Decided to develop "workable relationship"
- Try to exploit his expertise
- Avoid "extreme step" of elimination

## The Movement to Shukratal

### May 1759: Returning from Sutlej

**The Route:**
- Returned from banks of Sutlej River (Punjab)
- Finished stabilizing Punjab (or tried to)
- Crossed Yamuna **near Panipat**
- Camped at **Shamli**

**Geographic Context:**
- Sutlej = major river in Punjab
- Starts from Himalayas
- Flows through India
- Empties into Sindhu

**Panipat:**
- Historic town (site of major battles)
- Today in Haryana state
- Yamuna crossing point

### The Bridge at Shukratal

**The Plan:**
- Cross Ganga at **Shukratal**
- Use bridge of boats built by Najeeb
- Proceed on eastern conquest
- Najeeb promised "all the help"

**What's Shukratal:**
- Place on eastern banks of Ganga
- If Najeeb builds pontoon bridge here
- Dattaji can cross from west to east bank
- Army, horses, everything crosses on bridge

---

## The Fatal Weakness Exposed

### Marathas Never Mastered River Crossings

**The Core Problem:**
> "Crossing rivers in North India in the monsoons was a task the Marathas never quite mastered and this neglect was to cost them dearly."

**Why This Will Matter:**
- "You're going to see that more and more as we go into the next year"
- Rivers must be crossed to wage war effectively
- "Unless you go where the enemy is, you can't fight a war"
- All these problems coming "very quickly"

### The Engineering Gap

**The Maratha Background:**
- Originally farmers from Deccan
- Fought in dry season (winter months)
- Would farm during monsoon
- Return to military in dry season
- **Never developed skills to wage war in monsoon**
- **Never developed river-crossing technology**

**Not in Their Toolbox:**
- "That wasn't in their toolbox"
- Didn't evolve technologically
- Never had to cross major rivers in Deccan

**Northern India Different:**
- "Lots of rivers that they had to cross"
- Especially during monsoon = stuck
- "Very bad thing for your military campaign"
- Waste time, lose momentum

---

## Abdali's Seasonal Pattern

### Why Abdali Timed His Invasions

**The Afghan Problem:**
> "Abdali didn't want to be in India during the summer months."

**Why:**
- Afghans don't like Indian heat
- Too hot and humid
- Afghanistan is much cooler (further north)
- Can't tolerate Indian summer

**The Invasion Schedule:**
- **Start: October** (after hot season)
- Stay in India through winter
- Do looting, massacres, campaigns
- **Leave: April** (before summer begins)

**April-June:**
- Extremely hot = Indian summer
- Abdali's forces can't handle it

**June onwards:**
- Monsoon begins
- Heavy rains, soggy earth
- Armies can't move easily
- Travel becomes very difficult
- Can get stuck

**River Problem in Monsoon:**
- Even with pontoon technique, difficult to cross
- Rivers that are normally half-mile wide
- Become three miles wide in monsoon
- Makes crossing nearly impossible

**Abdali's Advantage:**
- Despite problems, still more skilled than Marathas
- "Little better than Marathas"
- But Marathas **completely dependent** on locals

---

## The Local Advantage

### Gujars: The River Experts

**Who Were Gujars:**
- **Local people** who lived around rivers
- Had expertise to cross rivers
- Knew the **fords** (shallow crossing points)
- Even in monsoon, knew where depth wasn't too much

**Their Service:**
- Paid by armies passing through
- Provided critical intelligence
- Showed where to cross safely
- Made army movement possible

**The Knowledge Gap:**
> "We are going to see how that made a huge difference. Tremendous difference."

---

## The British Learn This Lesson

### 40 Years Later

**General Wellington's Strategy (circa 1800):**
> "Even 40 years later, the English General Wellington laid down to his troops that a war against the Marathas should commence in June to take advantage of flooded rivers that the Marathas could not cross."

**What This Shows:**
- Maratha weakness persisted for HALF A CENTURY
- Never developed river-crossing capability
- British exploited this systematically
- Started campaigns during monsoon deliberately
- Knew Marathas would be immobilized by rivers

---

## Dattaji's Letter to Peshwa (6 August 1759)

### The Strategy Explained

**What Dattaji Wrote:**

> "I hope to complete the job in Bengal soon. Najeeb Khan's agent has promised he will accompany me with his army. If he comes, it is good. If he does not, I will punish him and go to the east."

**The Problem:**
- "This will take time and delay the larger venture of going to Bengal"
- Can't afford delay

**The Decision:**
> "I am therefore taking his help to cross the Ganga and go to Shuja's province."

**The Priority:**
> "The debts the Swami [Peshwa] has incurred will be paid by the revenues of Bengal."

> "Day and night I am seized of the matter of paying off these debts. I will labor to obtain the funds to repay these debts."

### What This Reveals

**Dattaji Knows:**
- Peshwa's top priority = money
- Must get to Bengal to collect revenue
- Debt situation is critical

**The Fatal Trade-off:**
- Left Punjab on its own (undermanned)
- Priority is paying off loans = must reach Bengal
- But before Bengal, must cross Ganga
- Depending entirely on Najeeb Khan for bridge
- Ignored Peshwa's orders to eliminate Najeeb

## Timeline

- **21 March 1759** - Peshwa warns about Najeeb: "like Abdali being in Delhi"
- **2 May 1759** - Peshwa calls Najeeb "crook" and "half Abdali"
- **March-May 1759** - Six months of repeated warnings to crush Najeeb
- **May 1759** - Dattaji returns from Sutlej, crosses Yamuna at Panipat

---

## Major Themes

### 1. The Fatal Assumption
Everything depends on Abdali staying in Afghanistan. If not...

### 2. Ignoring the Prophet
Peshwa warned repeatedly about Najeeb. Dattaji ignored him. Classic tragic flaw.

### 3. The Technical Gap
Lack of river-crossing ability = strategic weakness that persists for 50 years.

### 4. Religious vs. Economic
Holy cities matter religiously, but Shuja keeps them for economic reasons. Money wins.

### 5. The Snake's Game
Najeeb promises help, stalls, lies. Dattaji too gullible to see through it.

### 6. Overextension
Trying to hold Punjab AND reach Bengal = spreading too thin.

### 7. Local Knowledge Matters
Gujars' knowledge of fords = critical advantage. Outsiders at disadvantage.

---

## The Ominous Setup

**Late 1759:**
- Dattaji camped at Shamli, waiting for bridge
- Dependent on Najeeb (who is lying)
- Punjab left undermanned
- Abdali potentially finishing Afghan civil war
- Peshwa's warnings ignored
- Rivers about to become barriers
- Monsoon season approaching

**The Question:**
> "We are heading to the point where Peshwa is going to be very, very severely shocked."

**The Awakening:**
- Peshwa has been in a "slumber"
- About to be "awakened through his slumber"
- Will have to "take drastic steps"

---

*Dattaji stands at the banks of the Ganga, depending on a snake to build him a bridge, having ignored his master's warnings for six months. Punjab sits undermanned behind him. Bengal beckons with its wealth ahead. And in Afghanistan, Abdali is finishing his civil war, preparing to notice that the Marathas have made a fatal mistake. The cobra is being fed milk, and it's about to strike.*
