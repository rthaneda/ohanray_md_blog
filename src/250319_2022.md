## The Warning: Things Are About to Get Tragic

### The Narrator's Preface

**The Tone Shift:**

## The Maratha Collapse: Starvation and Demoralization

### The Multiple Crises

**The Resource Crisis:**
- Starving army
- Running out of food
- Running out of supplies
- Running out of money
- Can't sustain indefinitely

**The Psychological Crisis:**
- Getting demoralized
- Hunger sapping morale
- No allies in area
- Totally alien territory
- Can't count on local support

**The Coalition Failure:**
- Sikhs didn't come to aid
- No Sikh-Maratha alliance
- Sikhs didn't sacrifice supplies
- No mutual understanding
- Completely alone

### The Peshwa's Impotent Response

**The Attempt:**
- Peshwa "willing to put life on line"
- "False bravery" attempting help
- Trying to mount counterattack
- Can't go forward due to health
- Tb preventing bold action

**The Reality:**
- 1,500 miles distance
- 4 months to reach battlefield
- Rivers and terrain obstacles
- Health deteriorating
- Moral support only (meaningless)

## The December Skirmishes: The Games Begin

### The Intervening Period

**The Timeframe:**
- Month and a half before actual battle
- Many skirmishes during this period
- Major events happening
- Getting progressively worse for Marathas
- Bad for Maratha morale

**The Scale:**
- Each skirmish like whole battle on smaller scale
- Big-time battles despite being skirmishes
- Significant casualties
- Real combat, not just probing

---

## The Death of Appa Barwant Rao Mehendri

### Who Was He?

**His Status:**
- Upper-level commander (Bhau's level)
- Very important commander
- In perfect sync with Bhau
- Appa Barwant Chowk in Pune named after him
- On same wavelength with Bhau

**His Alliance:**
- Unlike Holkar-Bhau tension
- Mehendri and Bhau completely aligned
- Both believed in same strategy
- Both advocated artillery-focused warfare
- United in vision

### The December Skirmish Death

**The Battle:**
- December skirmish involving major commanders
- Jankoji Shinde's group getting weaker
- Mehendri goes to help Jankoji
- Gets surrounded by Afghan forces
- Trapped in difficult position

**The Beheading Attempt:**
- Afghan forces trying to behead him
- Trophy mentality (like scalp-taking)
- Capture = decapitation goal
- Had captured him
- Attempted execution

**The Rescue and Death:**
- Maratha forces learned of capture
- Came to his aid
- Saved him from decapitation
- But half his head already cut off
- "Half dead" when rescued

**The Final Insult:**
- Died before leaving skirmish
- Dead body brought back
- Afghans didn't get trophy
- But took his life anyway
- One of Bhau's best commanders gone

### The Significance

**The Loss:**
- Not ordinary commander
- Upper-level strategic figure
- Bhau's trusted ally
- Could have inspired army
- His loss demoralizing

**The Brutality:**
- Shows Afghan tactics
- Scalping/trophy mentality
- Dehumanizing warfare
- Psychological terror
- Evidence of savagery

**The Age Factor:**
- Possibly 40s (guessing)
- Not young/quick
- Maybe slower reactions
- Wrong place/wrong time
- Combat fatigue factor

## The Strategic Reassessment: Bhau's December Communications

### The December 23 Letter

**The Context:**
- After month+ of stalemate
- After numerous skirmishes
- Marathas getting worse
- Still projecting confidence

**The Content:**
- "Don't worry about bills"
- "We are here, we'll take care of it"
- Bills = payment obligations
- Still trying to pay vendors
- Reassuring about finances

**The Subtext:**
- Money still an issue
- Trying to maintain normalcy
- Vendors still supplying (somehow)
- Credit system still functioning
- Can't fully acknowledge crisis

### Nana Fadnavis's Assessment

**The Overview:**
- "Everything went as per intention"
- Except for Mehendri's death
- General strategy on track
- But losing key commanders
- Attrition taking toll

---

## The Emerging Pattern

### What's Becoming Clear

**The Mathematical Reality:**
- Skirmishes = major battles (casualties similar)
- Each month losing commanders
- Each month losing soldiers
- Each month weaker position
- Trajectory toward catastrophe

**The Psychological Reality:**
- Morale declining steadily
- Hunger eroding confidence
- Cold weather taking toll
- Deaths of important figures demoralizing
- Sense of doom building

**The Strategic Reality:**
- Can't win through attrition
- Afghans better positioned for waiting
- Marathas deteriorating
- Must break stalemate soon
- But any break = desperate attack

---

## The Dual Attrition Strategy

### What's Happening

**Both Sides Doing Same Thing:**
- Trying to cut each other's supplies
- Trying to starve opponent
- Trying to demoralize enemy
- Trying to force attack
- Waiting for first to break

**The Maratha Problem:**
- Breaking faster
- Losing commanders
- Losing soldiers
- Losing supplies
- Losing hope

**The Afghan Advantage:**
- Breaking slower
- Supplies more assured
- Leadership more united
- Morale more stable
- Time is their ally

---

## The Atmosphere: Winter and Death

### The Physical Environment

**The Cold:**
- December cold biting
- Northern India winter severe
- Marathas unprepared (summer clothes)
- Afghans prepared (leather coats)
- Physical suffering increasing

**The Darkness:**
- Literal: winter darkness earlier
- Metaphorical: atmosphere growing dark
- Sense of doom increasing
- Hope fading
- Despair building

### The Accumulating Deaths

**The Pattern:**
- Krishnaji Joshi: stray bullet
- Appa Mehendri: beheaded
- Unnamed soldiers: skirmishes
- Each death = demoralizing
- Pressure building

---

## Key Themes

1. **The Irreversible Decline** - Marathas deteriorating faster than Afghans
2. **The Attrition Trap** - Both using same strategy, one breaks faster
3. **The Command Loss** - Important commanders dying (Mehendri)
4. **The Physical Suffering** - Cold, hunger, inadequate equipment
5. **The Psychological Collapse** - Morale declining with each death
6. **The False Optimism** - Still projecting confidence while deteriorating
7. **The Inevitable End** - Only question is when, not if
8. **The Brutality** - Afghan tactics showing savagery and terror

---

**Where This Leads:** By December, the Maratha position is crumbling. Mehendri's death in a skirmish—half his head cut off before rescue—shows the brutality of what's happening. Each skirmish costs commanders. Each cold night costs soldiers to freezing. Each day costs food to starvation. Bhau still sends letters trying to reassure people about paying bills, but the reality is deteriorating rapidly. The Afghans are stronger, better supplied, better positioned, and more patient. The Marathas are breaking faster. The question is no longer whether they can win. It's whether they can survive.

*December came and with it the cold that killed as surely as swords. Appa Mehendri went into a skirmish to save Jankoji Shinde. The Afghans surrounded him. Cut at his head with swords. His soldiers came and saved him from beheading—barely. But half his head was already gone. He was "half dead" before they brought his body back. One of Bhau's best commanders. The one who believed in the same strategy. Dead before the real battle even started. And the skirmishes kept happening. Each one another battle. Each one costing more commanders, more soldiers, more hope. Winter had come. The cold was killing. The hunger was killing. And the Afghans were patiently waiting while the Marathas slowly broke apart.*
