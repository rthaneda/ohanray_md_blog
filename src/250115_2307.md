---

## Suja's Continuing Hope for Peace

**His Viewpoint:**
> "If this issue of the friction between Afghans and Marathas, if that can be resolved by some kind of a give and take and no battle, no violence, then that will be the best outcome."

**Why:**
- Now feeling **uneasy** even having joined Abdali
- With Marathas also: feels uneasy
- **Neither here nor there**
- Stuck in middle
- No good position

---

## Surajmal Jat: The Most Shrewd Politician

- How to get things with giving minimal stuff
- That was the general understanding

---

## Why He Survived: Geography and Diplomacy

### The Location

**Where His Kingdom Was:**
- **South of Delhi**
- But **not too far away**
- Strategic position
- In the thick of things

### The Survival Story

**The Challenge:**
> "During many, many frictions, wars, battles, this kingdom had survived because Surajmal Jat or his predecessors were well versed with the art of diplomacy and trying to not get involved in battles of other people."

**Why This Was Hard:**
- Not far away from lots of clashes
- Area full of all kinds of issues
- Battles
- Violence
- Stuff like that

**How They Did It:**
- Art of **diplomacy**
- Not getting involved in others' battles
- **Survival strategy**
- Playing politics well

### The Formula

**What Made It Possible:**
> "It was all possible because Mr. Jat, his statesmanship and his shrewdness along with his power."

**The Result:**
- Kept kingdom away from lots of bloodshed
- Through combination of:
  - **Statesmanship**
  - **Shrewdness**
  - **Power** (military capability)

---

## The Test of His Shrewdness

### Why Now Was Critical

**The Situation:**
> "Now was the time for Surajmal Jat's, how do you deal with different parties and apply the kind of logic to get what you want but not give in too much."

**The Challenge:**
- Both armies going to get into his **territory**
- Had to **side with one or the other**
- **No way** he could stand neutral
- That's why it was a test

**The Risk:**
- Neither could he join with Abdali (risky)
- Had to **toe the line**
- So far had stayed away
- But now: what happens?

---

## Surajmal's History with Abdali

### The Previous Siege

**What Happened:**
> "Before the previous attack by Abdali, Surajmal had turned it to be fruitless."

**The Details:**
- Abdali had attacked Surajmal himself before
- Laid **siege to his fort**
- Soldiers falling prey to **cholera** or something
- Already **summer**
- Finally gave up on siege
- Had to get out of it

**The Result:**
- **Nishfar** = unfruitful, didn't succeed
- Abdali couldn't really do damage to Surajmal
- In previous invasions

### The Other Siege (Different Incident)

**Another Time:**
- During **Raghunath Rao**'s time
- Marathas got out through **tunnel**
- Afghan army got in
- Took possession
- But that was before this

**The Pattern:**
- Last time: fruitless
- Afghan soldiers were **tired**
- Especially when **summertime** came
- Not used to summer season in India
- **Too hot** for them

### Why Afghans Wanted to Leave

**The Reasons:**
1. Too hot (not used to it)
2. Missing families
3. Missing lifestyle
4. Stuff like that

**Their Intention:**
- Never to **settle in India**
- Didn't like it there
- **Loot and go back**
- Not for too long

### Maratha Soldiers: Same Problem

**The Parallel:**
> "Marathas also had the same problem. Maratha soldiers, unless it was Shinde and Hawker, otherwise they wanted to go there, do their job and come back."

**The Difference:**
- Didn't want to stick around
- **Unless** you are Shinde or Holkar armies
- Those were based in north
- Others wanted to go home

---

## Abdali Wants Surajmal Too

### The Need

**Why Abdali Needed Him:**
> "Abdali needed Surajmal to be on his side to oppose Sudarshi Rao Bahu's strong army."

**The Reasoning:**
- Already has **Suja-ud-Daula** on his side (done)
- But still: to make sure victorious position
- Wanted **also** Surajmal Jat on his side
- Can't afford to lose him now

**The Strategy:**
- Build up alliances
- Maximize forces
- Ensure victory
- Surajmal was powerful
- Would help take on Bhau without too much trouble

---

## Surajmal's Response: Hard No

### The Rejection

**What Abdali Did:**
- Sent his **request**
- Sent his **demands**
- "Join me"

**Surajmal's Response:**
- Figure of speech: he just totally **rejected** it
- Said: "**None of that is going to happen**"
- "I'm **not joining** your side"
- Hard no

---

## Why Surajmal Wasn't Conflicted Like Suja

### The Difference

**The Contrast:**
> "He was not in so much of a dilemma as Suja Udola was."

**Why:**
- He wasn't **Muslim**
- It wasn't holy war (for him)
- Different considerations

### The Camaraderie Factor

**His Feelings:**
- Probably had little bit of **sympathy**
- Not sympathy exactly
- Kind of **camaraderie** with Sadashiv Rao Bhau
- Because both **Hindu**

---

## The Eyewitness Advantage

### What Surajmal Had Seen

**The Critical Difference:**
> "Mr. Jat had seen a lot of these atrocities up close. He knew exactly what these people are capable of and how they have handled in the previous..."

**The Contrast:**
- Bhau and Nana Sahib were deep in the **south**
- Ignorant to how **savage** Abdali and comrades were
- Depending on:
  - Eyewitness accounts
  - Hearsay
  - This and that

**Surajmal's Knowledge:**
- Had seen **exactly** what happens
- With his **own eyes**
- Close to the action
- **First-hand experience**

### The Impact of Proximity

**Why It Mattered:**
- He knew
- Wasn't messing around
- Wasn't wishy washy
- Had **survived** these brutal invasions
- Had seen Abdali's way of dealing
- Saw the **route** (carnage)
- What happens

**The Location Factor:**
- Not too far away
- Little bit south of Delhi
- Maybe within **150 kilometers**
- That's it
- Pretty close by

---

## The Geographic Context

### Under the Thumb

**The Reality:**
- Under thumb of all the **Mughals**
- And now **Abdali**
- Very close to all the action
- Can't escape it

### The Vassal History

**During Mughal Strength:**
- Were basically kind of **vassal** of Mughals
- When they were strong
- But after **Aurangzeb's death**
- About 30-40 years later
- Whole Mughal empire started collapsing

**The Liberation Process:**
- People within kingdoms who were vassals
- Started feeling more **liberated**
- Were only **namesake** in Mughal empire
- Started saying: "We will do whatever we want"
- As Mughals became weaker
- "Screw you, we will do whatever we want"

**The Independence Feeling:**
- Started growing with time
- But Aurangzeb's time: **no way**
- He was so strong
- Would simply **crush you**

---

## The Jat People

### Who They Are

**The Characteristics:**
- Surajmal had **forefather** during Aurangzeb's time
- Was his vassal, loyally
- Jat people: fairly **battle-hardened**
- Very (tough)

**Martial People:**
- Kind of martial people
- Even today: in Indian army in **large numbers**

### Not Sikhs

**The Clarification:**
- They are **not Sikhs** at all
- Nothing to do with Sikhism
- They are **Hindu**

**The Turban:**
- Don't wear Sikh turban
- But turban is worn in India in variety of cultures

- Even in Maharashtra: lot of farmers wear turban
- But it's **not** the Sikh turban
- Sikh turban is different
- You can spot it

---

## Surajmal Rejects Abdali (Again)

### The Clear Position

**What He Said:**
> "Ato Abdali, screw you. I'm not coming on your side."

**The Previous Condition:**
- Remember earlier he told him:
- "You sit on **throne of Delhi**"
- "Then I will join you as a result"
- Several pages ago

**The Rejection:**
- Now rejected the proposal of **alliance with Abdali**
- Clear and final

---

## Waiting for Bhau's Protection

### The New Situation

**What Surajmal Was Doing:**
> "Now Suraj Mal was waiting for Bahu to come into his province or into his kingdom because he had already declined Abdali's alliance offer."

**The Danger:**
- Now he was in **danger**
- Since said no
- Abdali could **attack** him
- Attack his forces
- Needed now Bhau's **protection**

### Why Bhau's Arrival Matters

**The Expectation:**
- Expecting Bhau would come
- **Secure his territory**
- At least the area around there

**The Logic:**
> "The moment Bahu comes closer then Abdali won't try to get in there because then that will lead to battle right then and there."

**The Strategy:**
- If Bhau's camp is **nearby**
- Abdali won't venture in that area
- Battle won't be pretty
- Everybody knew: battle going to be **extremely violent**
- Lots and lots of people going to die
- Everybody was very **careful**

### The Delayed Battle

**Why No Immediate Fight:**
- Weren't messing around
- Won't start it immediately
- Just like that
- Had very **potent weapons**
- Going to be very **messy**

**The Prerequisites:**
> "It had to be well thought of, well prepared and all politics has to be taken care of before they actually begin shooting at each other."

**The Process:**
- Signing up **alliances**
- Two alliances
- Signing up people on their side
- Before starting any hostile activity
- That's the **politics**

**The Timeline:**
- Until that is over
- No way they will go back
- We know eventually takes until **next year**
- **January or February**

---

## The Only Northern Ally

### The Distinction

**The Unique Position:**
> "So now that is the distinction of Surajmal. He was the only king in the northern India who was willing to get into the Maratha alliance."

**The Commitment:**
- Willing to explicitly
- Enter their **coalition**
- Not just talk
- Actually join

### The Past Friction

**What He Remembered:**
- He had gotten into some trouble during **Holkar**
- **Holkar's son was killed** (at his fort)
- Then Holkar got **angry**
- Laid a siege
- All that happened

**But:**
> "Still the relationship was fairly friendly between Marathas and Surajmal Jat. They were still getting along."

**The Decision:**
- He said: "Okay, fine"
- "I will go on the **Maratha side**"

---

## Still Hedging: Contact with Suja

### The Multiple Connections

**The Reality:**
> "And even though he was thinking about Maratha alliance, he was still in touch with Suja Udawala."

**Why:**
- Everybody was **angling**
- See which side is going to win
- That was **critically important**
- Whichever side wins
- They wanted to throw their lot on that side
- Everyone's looking around
- Seeing what moves is everyone else making

---

## The Alliance with Holkar and Imad-ul-Mulk

### Starting in 1760

**The Welcome:**
> "Starting in 1760, Surajmal Jat had welcomed both Holkar and Imad Hurmult, who was the wazir of the Mughal Empire."

**The Timing:**
- Getting along with both those parties
- Holkar probably given up previous anger
- Given up enmity
- **One year prior** he had welcomed them
- (Actually same year - July 1760)

---

## Surajmal's Real Ambition: Rule Delhi

### The Self-Interest

**The Reality:**
> "So you have to understand now, Mr. Surajmal Jat's also intention is to get something for himself, not because Hindu that was there."

**What He Wanted:**
- To get something in the **Mughal Empire**
- Some position
- Some power
- Self-interested

### The Plan with Imad-ul-Mulk

**The Conspiracy:**
> "Imad Hurmult and Surajmal Jat were thinking of kicking out the emperor and basically running the whole show in Delhi."

**The Details:**
- Ending the **Mughal Empire** as they know it
- May have some "stupid guy" as emperor
- Just for the heck of it
- But basically: "Both of us will manage the Mughal Empire"

**Surajmal's Ambitions:**
- Even though kingdom was fairly **small**
- His **ambitions were tall**
- Trying to conspire
- Take down whole Mughal Empire
- Or be in charge of it
- **Along with Imad-ul-Mulk**

**The Goal:**
> "I want to be the henchman of the Mughal Empire along with Imad Hurmult."

---

## Using Marathas, Not Being Used by Them

### The Strategy

**The Calculation:**
- If Marathas can help me: **so be it**
- But would **not allow** Marathas to control Mughal Empire
- "I'm sitting here"
- "I want to be the guy"
- "A powerful guy"
- "I'm in the north"
- "You guys are not from here"

### The Regional Resentment

**The Pattern:**
> "So both Rajputs and Surajmal Jat, they considered Marathas to be kind of coming in between, you know, your southern power."

**The Message:**
- **Stay in your place**
- We want to handle **northern politics**
- Northern power structure
- You can **help us**
- But beyond that
- Don't try to **control us**

### The Limited Alliance

**Surajmal's Thinking:**
- Split loyalties
- But decided: supporting Marathas is best **chess move**
- For now
- Wanted to get rid of emperor
- With **help** of Marathas
- Form alliance with Imad-ul-Mulk
- Marathas go back
- That's his thought

**The Usage:**
> "So make use of Marathas. To whichever degree possible."

---

## Major Themes

### 1. Shrewdness Through Survival

**The Reputation:**
- Most shrewd politician of era
- Not official title = **consensus**
- Earned through decades of survival

**How He Did It:**
- **Geography** (close but not too close)
- **Diplomacy** (avoiding others' battles)
- **Power** (military capability)
- **Statesmanship** (knowing when to act)

**The Formula:**
- Not just strength
- Not just diplomacy
- **Both together**
- Plus timing
- Plus knowing when to stay out

### 2. The Eyewitness Advantage

**Surajmal vs. Bhau/Nana Sahib:**
- Surajmal: **seen it first-hand**
- Bhau/Nana: **heard stories**
- Huge difference

**What He'd Seen:**
- Abdali's atrocities
- Up close
- How they handle things
- What they're capable of
- The route (carnage)
- The brutality

**The Impact:**
- Wasn't conflicted like Suja
- Knew exactly what he was dealing with
- Not wishy washy
- Hard no to Abdali
- Based on knowledge, not ideology

### 3. The Climate Weapon

**Why Abdali Failed Before:**
- **Summer too hot**
- Afghans not used to it
- Soldiers getting sick (**cholera**)
- Missing families
- Want to go home
- Never intended to settle

**The Pattern:**
- Come in winter
- Raid, loot
- Leave before summer
- Can't sustain long campaigns
- Climate defeats them

**Surajmal's Knowledge:**
- He knew this
- Seen it happen
- Could wait them out
- Geography + time = defense

### 4. The Only Northern Ally

**The Uniqueness:**
> "He was the ONLY king in the northern India who was willing to get into the Maratha alliance."

**What This Shows:**
- How isolated Marathas were
- How hostile north was
- Surajmal's pragmatism
- His risk-taking
- His strategic thinking

**The Contrast:**
- Rajputs: hostile or neutral
- Suja: forced to join Abdali
- Other Muslims: with Abdali
- Surajmal: **only one** willing

### 5. The Forgiveness Factor

**What Happened:**
- Holkar's son **killed** at Surajmal's fort
- Holkar got **angry**
- Laid siege
- Big conflict

**But Now:**
- Relationship fairly **friendly**
- Getting along
- Past enmity: set aside
- Welcomed Holkar in 1760

**What It Shows:**
- Pragmatism over grudges
- Strategic alliances
- Can forgive when necessary
- Politics > personal feelings

### 6. The Hedging Strategy

**The Reality:**
- Committed to Maratha alliance
- But still in contact with **Suja**
- Watching both sides
- Seeing who's winning
- Everyone angling

**The Logic:**
- Critically important which side wins
- Want to be on winning side
- Keep options open
- Don't burn bridges completely
- Until absolutely necessary

### 7. The Real Ambition: Delhi

**The Conspiracy:**
- With Imad-ul-Mulk
- **Kick out emperor**
- Both rule Delhi together
- Use Marathas to help
- Then send Marathas back south

**The Irony:**
- Kingdom fairly **small**
- But ambitions **tall**
- Wants to control Mughal Empire
- Not content with what he has
- Reaching for much more

**The Calculation:**
- Marathas can **help**
- But won't **control**
- Use them, don't be used
- "I'm in the north, you're from south"
- "Stay in your place"

### 8. The Regional Resentment

**Northern Powers' View:**
- Marathas: **southern power**
- "Coming in between"
- Want to handle own politics
- Own power structure
- You can help
- But don't control us

**The Pattern:**
- Rajputs feel this
- Surajmal feels this
- Common northern sentiment
- Marathas as outsiders
- Even when helping

### 9. The Vassal to Independent Arc

**The History:**
- During Aurangzeb: total **vassals**
- Would be **crushed** if resisted
- No independence possible

**The Transition:**
- After his death (30-40 years)
- Mughal empire **collapsing**
- Former vassals feeling **liberated**
- Only namesake in empire
- "Screw you, do whatever we want"

**Surajmal's Position:**
- Part of this liberation
- No longer true vassal
- Independent actor
- But still close to Delhi
- Can't fully escape orbit

### 10. The Martial Heritage

**Jat People:**
- Battle-hardened
- Martial people
- Even today: large numbers in army
- Not Sikhs (Hindu)
- Different turban tradition

**The Survival:**
- This heritage helped
- Could defend themselves
- Not pushovers
- Respected for military capability
- Essential to survival strategy

---

## Critical Insights

### The Geography-Diplomacy Formula

**Why He Survived:**
1. Close enough to matter (150km from Delhi)
2. Far enough to have buffer
3. Strong enough to defend
4. Smart enough to avoid fights
5. Diplomatic enough to negotiate

**The Balance:**
- Not too weak (would be crushed)
- Not too strong (would threaten others)
- Not too far (would be irrelevant)
- Not too close (would be absorbed)
- **Just right** for survival

### The Eyewitness Effect

**Why Surajmal Chose Differently Than Suja:**

**Suja:**
- Muslim
- Far from action (Lucknow)
- Heard stories
- Religious pressure
- Conflicted
- Eventually caved

**Surajmal:**
- Hindu (no religious pressure)
- Close to action (150km from Delhi)
- **Saw it first-hand**
- Knew exactly what Abdali capable of
- Not conflicted
- Hard no

**The Variable:**
- **Proximity to horror**
- Seeing vs. hearing
- Direct knowledge
- Makes all the difference

### The Climate as Alliance-Breaker

**Why Abdali Failed:**
- Previous siege of Surajmal
- Summer came
- Too hot
- Soldiers sick (cholera)
- Want to go home
- Had to leave

**The Lesson:**
- Afghans **can't sustain** in India
- Climate defeats them
- They know it
- Must raid and leave
- Can't stay long-term

**Surajmal's Knowledge:**
- Seen this pattern
- Knows they'll leave
- Just has to survive
- Until summer
- Or until they get homesick

### The Ambition Paradox

**The Reality:**
- Small kingdom
- Tall ambitions
- Wants to rule Delhi
- Conspiring with Imad-ul-Mulk

**The Strategy:**
- Use Marathas to kick out emperor
- Then rule jointly with Imad-ul-Mulk
- Send Marathas back south
- "Don't control us"

**The Contradiction:**
- Needs Marathas
- But resents them
- Wants their help
- But not their influence
- Alliance of convenience
- Not conviction

### The Only Ally Problem

**For Marathas:**
- **One** northern ally
- Out of many kingdoms
- Everyone else: hostile or neutral
- Shows isolation
- Shows vulnerability

**For Surajmal:**
- Taking huge risk
- Standing alone
- Against northern consensus
- Could be punished
- If Marathas lose

**The Stakes:**
- If wrong: ruined
- If right: rewards
- But incredibly risky
- Most others playing safe

### The Forgiveness Calculus

**What Happened:**
- Holkar's son killed (at his fort)
- Major incident
- Siege in response
- Should be permanent enmity

**But:**
- Forgave
- Reconciled
- Now allies
- Working together

**Why:**
- **Politics > emotions**
- Strategic necessity
- Bigger threats exist
- Can't afford grudges
- Pragmatism wins

**The Lesson:**
- In politics: forgive when useful
- Don't let personal feelings
- Override strategic calculation
- Grudges are luxury
- Survival demands flexibility

### The Hedging as Weakness

**The Strategy:**
- Committed to Marathas
- But still talking to Suja
- Watching both sides
- Keeping options open

**The Problem:**
- Shows uncertainty
- Lack of full commitment
- Others can see this
- Weakens alliance
- Neither side fully trusts

**The Necessity:**
- Can't afford to be wrong
- Stakes too high
- Need insurance
- But insurance costs trust

### The Regional Identity

**The North-South Divide:**
- Northerners see Marathas as southerners
- "Stay in your place"
- "Don't control us"
- Regional resentment
- Even from allies

**The Implication:**
- Even if Marathas win
- Northern powers won't accept rule easily
- Will resist
- Will conspire
- Unity fragile

**For Marathas:**
- Winning battle not enough
- Must win acceptance
- Very difficult
- Regional identities strong
- "You're not from here"

### The Tall Ambitions

**The Irony:**
- Smallest player
- Biggest ambitions
- Wants to rule Delhi
- Mughal Empire itself

**The Logic:**
- Sees weakness
- Sees opportunity
- Why not reach?
- Power vacuum exists
- Someone will fill it
- Why not him?

**The Reality:**
- Probably unrealistic
- But not impossible
- Stranger things happened
- Mughal Empire really collapsing
- Maybe he could
- With right allies
- At right moment

### The Make-Use-Of Strategy

**Surajmal's Thinking:**
> "Make use of Marathas. To whichever degree possible."

**The Attitude:**
- Instrumental
- Transactional
- Use them
- Don't be used
- Get what you need
- Then...?

**The Problem for Marathas:**
- Their "ally" using them
- Not true partnership
- Will dump them
- Once gets what he wants
- Know this going in?
- Probably
- What choice do they have?

---

## What's Coming

**The Situation:**
- Surajmal rejected Abdali
- Only northern ally for Marathas
- Waiting for Bhau's protection
- Still talking to Suja (hedging)
- Conspiring with Imad-ul-Mulk
- To rule Delhi jointly
- Planning to use Marathas
- Then send them back south

**The Questions:**
1. Will Bhau arrive in time?
2. Will Abdali attack before that?
3. Can Surajmal's hedging work?
4. Will conspiracy with Imad-ul-Mulk succeed?
5. Can Marathas trust their "only ally"?
6. Will regional resentment undermine alliance?

**The Stakes:**
- Surajmal took huge risk
- Standing alone among northern powers
- If Marathas lose: he's ruined
- If Marathas win: he wants Delhi
- But Marathas might not give it
- Complex game
- Many ways to lose
- Few ways to win

---

**July 1760: There's a reason Surajmal Jat is called the most shrewd politician of his era. For decades his small kingdom survived 150 kilometers south of Delhi by perfect balance of power and diplomacy, strength and timing. He's seen Abdali's atrocities first-hand - not stories, not hearsay, but with his own eyes. When Abdali asks him to join, he doesn't hesitate like Suja. He says: screw you, I'm not coming. He's the ONLY northern king willing to join the Marathas. Everyone else is hostile or neutral or forced into Abdali's camp. But here's what the Marathas don't know: Surajmal's conspiring with Imad-ul-Mulk to kick out the Mughal emperor and rule Delhi themselves. His plan? Use the Marathas to help, then send them back south. "I'm in the north, you guys are not from here. Stay in your place." His kingdom is small but his ambitions are tall. And he's still talking to Suja, hedging his bets, watching to see which side wins. He forgave Holkar for his son's death because politics matters more than grudges. He's playing chess while everyone else plays checkers. But he's taking a massive risk. Standing alone. If he's wrong, he's ruined. If he's right, he wants Delhi. The only question is: will Bhau get there in time to protect him? Because now that he's rejected Abdali, he's a target.**
