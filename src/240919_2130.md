# The Fatal Treaty & The Poisoned Nizam
## Why the Treaty Was a Mistake & The Murder in the Deccan

---

## Quick Recap: The Players on the Board

**The Setup:**
- **Safdar Jung** - Wazir with personal kingdom in Awadh (Doab)
- **Rohilla Afghan faction** - Proxies of Abdali at Mughal court
- **Ahmad Shah Abdali** - Staying in Afghanistan (for now)
- **Mir Manu** - Switched allegiance, now in Lahore between them all
- **Holkar and Shinde** - Armies positioned in the north
- **Nana Saheb Peshwa** - In Pune directing everything
- **Rajput Madhav Singh** - Bitter about Maratha interference
- **Jat King Surajmal** - Near Agra, irate that provinces given to Marathas

**The Potential Allies:**
- Jats = good fighters (like Sikhs)
- Could potentially be Peshwa's allies
- But they're angry right now

---

## The Treaty Recap (April 1752)

### What Was Signed

**When Ahmad Shah Abdali reached Lahore:**
- Safdar Jung sought Maratha help on behalf of Mughal Emperor
- Signed agreement with **Royal Seal** in **April 1752**

### The "Ridiculous Subterfuge"

**The Process:**
- Maratha chiefs had to **first apply to the Emperor on oath** for the terms
- Then the Emperor "agreed" to them
- Totally fake formality to make it look legitimate

### The Document: The Ahadnama

**What It Said:**
- Peshwa **obliged to defend the Emperor** against ALL internal and external enemies
- Payment: **50 lakh rupees**

**Tax Collection Rights:**
- Marathas given right to collect **one-fourth of the revenue** from:
  - The **Doab**
  - **Punjab**
  - **Sindh**
- **Problem:** Both Punjab and Sindh were **no longer in Mughal control**

**Additional Grants:**
- Peshwa granted governorship of **Agra and Ajmer**
- Two important imperial provinces
- **Jat King Surajmal** and **Jaipur's Madhav Rao** were ALSO vying for these

---

## The Slap in the Face

### Creating Enemies

**What Just Happened:**
- Jat King Surajmal wanted Agra/Ajmer
- Madhav Rao (Rajput) wanted Agra/Ajmer
- Both got **slapped in the face** - given to Marathas instead

**Why They Got Passed Over:**
- They weren't capable of protecting the Mughal Empire
- Didn't have that kind of army
- Only Marathas had the military power

### The Consequence

**The Mughal Grants Succeeded In:**
- Sparking a **contest between three Hindu powers:**
  1. Marathas
  2. Rajputs
  3. Jats

**Result:** They became **rivals** instead of allies

**The Problem:** They're NOT going to be loyal to any "Hindu cause" (if such a thing even exists)

---

## The Northern Reaction

### Everyone Wants Marathas Gone

**The Rise of Maratha Influence:**
- At Delhi
- Territorial ambitions increasing
- **Led northern powers to support ANYBODY who could push them back to the Deccan**

**The Situation:**
- Everybody in the north was interested in pushing Marathas south
- **Minus** the Emperor/Mughals (sort of)

### The Mughal Dilemma

**What They Actually Thought:**
- Wanted to push Marathas down south
- BUT knew there was **nobody who could protect them**
- Willing to tolerate Marathas in an **uneasy alliance**
- **Lesser of two evils**

**The Reality:**
- Had to have them
- Would rather not have them
- Like a **paper tiger** - they knew it
- So they tolerated Marathas

### The Problem for the Northern Powers

**The Math:**
- None of them could take on powerful Marathas
- Not **individually**
- Not even **in combination**
- Having a tough time with that

---

## The Emperor's Double-Cross (April 1752)

### The Timeline Bomb

**April 12, 1752:**
- Safdar Jung sealed the deal with the Marathas
- Treaty signed, Royal Seal applied

**April 13, 1752** (ONE DAY LATER):
- Emperor had **already ceded Punjab and Sindh to Abdali**
- Before Safdar Jung even arrived!

**April 25, 1752:**
- Wazir reached Delhi with Shinde and Holkar
- Found out what happened

### The Betrayal

**What the Emperor Did:**
- Refused to **ratify the agreement** signed by Safdar Jung
- Made the treaty essentially worthless for the Marathas

**Safdar Jung's Plan:**
- Take the Maratha chiefs with him
- Take Punjab back from Abdali
- **Now not possible** with the Emperor's capitulation

---

## The Rushed Decision: Why This Was a Mistake

### The Problem: No Peshwa Consultation

**What Happened:**
- **Shinde and Holkar** made this decision
- Did NOT consult Nana Saheb Peshwa
- Time was running out
- Decision had to be made **right away**

**Their Thinking:**
- "Let's do the decision on behalf of Peshwa"
- **Took sovereign power into their own hands**
- Said: "Yep, we are agreeable on behalf of the Peshwa"

### Were They Allowed to Do This?

**The Answer:** Sort of.
- They had **certain powers**
- Thought "it should be okay"
- It was a **golden opportunity**
- Peshwa was always **thirsty for money** (just like Abdali)
- Within realm of normalcy to spot opportunity and go for it

### Why They Thought It Would Be Fine

**The Logic:**
- Peshwa gets the money
- Shinde and Holkar take care of the northern front
- If any issue develops → they're responsible
- They're **autonomous in charge**

**The Division:**
- **Responsibility:** Shinde and Holkar (do the fighting)
- **Benefit:** Peshwa (gets the money)

**The Assumption:** Peshwa would be okay with this, probably

**Technically:** It was a **sovereign decision** made without proper authority

---

## Why This Was Disastrous: Sardesai's Analysis

### The Historian's Opinion

**Sardesai Wrote:**
- They had taken a **rash decision**
- Getting the Peshwa into this kind of contract
- Should have been done **after thorough analysis**
- Done **rashly** without proper consideration

### The Strategic Problems

**Problem #1: The Deccan Was Not Under Control**
- Situation in the Deccan was **not in complete control**
- Maratha power did **not have enough soldiers and war machinery**
- To take on this **new responsibility**
- Peshwa had campaigns in the south still going

**Problem #2: Getting Stretched Thin**
- Already fighting in the south
- Now committing to defend the north
- **Not pacified in the south yet**

**Problem #3: Direct Challenge to Abdali**
- With this contract, gave a **direct challenge to Abdali**
- Provoking him
- Now Abdali understands: if he goes to Delhi → fighting Marathas
- Mughals have **completely forsaken protection** of their own land
- Farmed it out to the Marathas

### The Conclusion

**Sardesai's Verdict:**
- Had **tremendous implications**
- Not thorough analysis was done before it was inked
- A strategic mistake

---

## The Tax Collection Problem

### The Reality of Implementation

**What They Were Given:**
- One-fourth taxes from Doab, Punjab, Sindh
- Right to governorship of Agra and Ajmer

**The Problem:**
- **They had to get those themselves**
- Had to go fight with Abdali's forces
- Put in the infrastructure
- Hire the people
- All that costs money and troops

### Why This Was Hard

**The Reality:**
- Nobody **wants** to pay taxes
- **You have to force them**
- That machinery has to be created
- To back up the machinery → need soldiers
- If town says "we won't pay" → need force to implement threat
- Need a **good force**

### The Consequence: Staying in Delhi

**What Happened:**
- Had to stay in Delhi
- Agra, Ajmer, and areas closest to Delhi
- Had to maintain presence

**The Problem:**
- Maratha force camped in Delhi
- Created **hassles for civilian population**
- Soldiers, machinery, horses in midst of civilian life
- These are **foreigners** - can't blend in easily
- Created **disharmony in Delhi**

**The Situation:**
- Sizable Maratha force presence
- Wouldn't leave until they got paid
- That was their major thing
- Did the whole Ahadnama **just for the sake of money**
- Certainly not leaving without it

---

## The New Nizam Problem

### The Deccan Strategy

**Peshwa's Order:**
- Get hold of **Nizam's son**
- Nizam was dead (1749 or 1750)
- Throne not completely filled

**The Location:**
- Nizam throne = **Hyderabad** (Deccan)
- His son was in **Delhi**

**The Order:**
- Get hold of this son
- Put him on the throne of Nizam
- "Nizam" is a title

### Why This Son?

**Peshwa's Reasoning:**
- This son was relatively **calm, quiet, and peaceful**
- Won't create constant troubles for Marathas in the south
- That's why he selected him as heir apparent

**Historical Context:**
- Remember: **Bajirao I** defeated this Nizam at Battle of Allahabad
- Encircled him, cut off his water supply
- Nizam had no option but to surrender
- That Nizam was now dead

### The Plan

**Peshwa's Guess (Hope):**
- Once Nizam's son is given the throne
- When he sits on throne
- Can **disengage forces from Deccan towards north**
- Free up armies to deal with northern situation

---

## The Transaction

### How It Worked

**The Emperor's Business Model:**
- This is how the Emperor made money
- Wasn't going to do this for free

**What Happened:**
- Emperor took **30 lakh rupees from Ghaziuddin** (the Nizam's son)
- In order to give him the throne of Nizam
- Beneficiary = Ghaziuddin (gets to be Nizam)

**Then:**
- Emperor turned around and **handed it to the Marathas**
- This was their payment (part of it)
- Then Marathas prepared to leave

---

## The Tragedy: Ghaziuddin's Murder

### The Assassination

**What Happened:**
- Ghaziuddin went to Deccan to sit on throne of Nizam
- His **stepmother invited him for dinner**
- She **mixed poison in the food**
- **Killed him**

### Why She Did It

**The Motive:**
- Probably had a son of her own
- Wanted HER son on the throne
- Ghaziuddin was in the way

### The Consequence

**For the Peshwa:**
- His plan of making somebody **obedient** the Nizam was **dynamited**
- Completely destroyed
- Cannot have his own obedient personality in the Nizam position
- Not going to happen

**For Ghaziuddin's Son:**
- Became very **scared**
- "What's going to happen to me?"
- Probably was a **minor** (young)

---

## Enter: Imad ul-Mulk

### The Survivor

**Who He Is:**
- Ghaziuddin's son
- Same person who will become **Imad ul-Mulk** in the future
- Will become somebody important

**Where He Was:**
- Maybe already in Delhi
- Or had come to Deccan with his father
- Father now dead from poison

**His Situation:**
- Stepmother probably didn't have it in mind to make him next Nizam
- Had to go back to safe environment
- Was **lost day and night** (feeling sad, tragic mood)
- Lost his father
- In very **precarious situation** (could be killed anytime)
- Didn't know who was trying these bad things

---

## Safdar Jung's Adoption

### The Rescue

**What Safdar Jung Did:**
- Started **loving him like his own son**
- Took him under his wing
- Raised him
- Made him **Mir Bakshi** (Commander-in-Chief)

**Amazing Turnaround:**
- Made out pretty well
- Now on the court of the Emperor
- Very powerful position

### His Age and Position

**How Young:**
- Just beyond 20 now (maybe 21, 22, maybe 24)
- Very young
- At age **16**, became Commander-in-Chief of the Mughal Army

---

## The Ungrateful Protégé

### His Character

**Imad ul-Mulk's Qualities:**
- Very smart (buddhi maan)
- BUT had **no idea about morals or moral standards**
- Very bright guy
- Didn't follow any due process
- Had **no moral standing**

**His Principles:**
- Victory at any cost, no matter what
- The ends justify the means

### The Betrayal Begins

**What He Did:**
- The **moment** he was made Mir Bakshi
- Started setting up **conspiracies against Safdar Jung**
- His own benefactor!
- Biting the hand that fed him

**His Nature:**
- Very **unscrupulous**
- Wanted **absolute power**

### His Reputation

**In the Next 10 Years:**
- Got reputation as the **most merciless commander or courtier** in the Emperor's court
- Ruthless and efficient
- Known to be without mercy

---

## The Deaths of 1754

### Mir Manu Dies (Natural Causes)

**What Happened:**
- 1754 - Mir Manu died
- By **natural death**
- Sitting on a horse
- Horse suddenly takes off
- He falls off the horse
- Gets hurt
- Dies from the injury

**Significance:**
- Just got unlucky
- NOT killed by Marathas
- They were NOT going to attack Lahore
- Natural accident

### Safdar Jung Dies (1754)

**What Happened:**
- 1754 - Safdar Jung also dies
- Believed to be natural causes

**The Consequence:**
- Now a **crop of new people** will come up
- Generation shift happening
- Old guard dying off

## Strategic Analysis

### Why the Treaty Was a Disaster

**The Problems:**
1. **Made without proper authority** - Shinde/Holkar acted alone
2. **No thorough analysis** - Rushed decision
3. **Overstretched forces** - South not pacified, now committing north
4. **Provoked Abdali** - Direct challenge to Afghan power
5. **Unenforceable terms** - Punjab and Sindh already lost
6. **Created Hindu rivalries** - Jats and Rajputs now enemies
7. **Implementation costs** - Had to collect taxes by force
8. **Civilian disruption** - Maratha presence in Delhi caused problems

### The Emperor's Brilliant Treachery

**What He Did:**
1. Let Safdar Jung negotiate with Marathas
2. Seal the deal with Royal Seal (April 12)
3. **Next day** - cede Punjab/Sindh to Abdali (April 13)
4. Refuse to ratify the agreement
5. Take 30 lakh from Ghaziuddin
6. Give it to Marathas (partial payment)
7. Let everyone fight it out

**Result:** Played all sides against each other

### The Poisoning's Impact

**What It Destroyed:**
- Peshwa's plan for friendly Nizam
- Stability in Deccan
- Ability to move forces north
- Strategic flexibility

**What It Created:**
- Imad ul-Mulk (future problem)
- Another conspirator against Safdar Jung
- More instability

---

## The Ironies

**Irony #1:**
- Safdar Jung saves Ghaziuddin's son
- Raises him as his own
- Makes him powerful
- He immediately betrays him

**Irony #2:**
- Treaty signed to protect Mughals
- Emperor undermines it the next day
- Makes it nearly worthless

**Irony #3:**
- Supposed to unite Hindu powers
- Instead creates rivalry between them
- Jats, Rajputs, Marathas now competing

**Irony #4:**
- Marathas get tax collection rights
- To territories no longer controlled by Mughals
- Have to fight Abdali to collect

---

## The Big Picture

### The Trap Tightens

**What Just Happened:**
1. Marathas committed to defending Delhi
2. But can't even collect the revenue to pay for it
3. Abdali knows they're coming
4. Northern Hindu powers are now enemies
5. Mughals playing everyone against each other
6. Deccan not secured yet
7. Forces stretched thin
8. Leadership dying off (1754)

### The Inevitability

**Why War Is Coming:**
- Abdali challenged
- Marathas contracted
- Northern powers want Marathas gone
- Emperor wants everyone fighting
- No way to back out without losing face
- No way to succeed without overextending

---

## Key Themes

1. **Rushed Decisions Have Consequences** - No proper analysis
2. **Treating Effects, Not Causes** - Treaty doesn't solve real problems
3. **The Emperor's Machiavellian Genius** - Plays all sides
4. **Ungrateful Beneficiaries** - Imad ul-Mulk betrays Safdar Jung
5. **The Poison Cup** - Court intrigue destroys strategic plans
6. **Overextension** - Can't fight in south AND commit to north
7. **Creating Enemies** - Jats and Rajputs turned against Marathas

---

**The stage is set. The trap is sprung. The mistakes are made. Deaths are coming. War is inevitable. And Abdali is watching...**
