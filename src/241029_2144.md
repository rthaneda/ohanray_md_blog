# The Siege of Delhi: Betrayal, Failed Negotiations & Abdali's Demands (1756-1757)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The News Reaches Delhi

### October 1756: The Warning

**The Messenger:**
- News of Abdali's approach reached Delhi in **October 1756**
- He was already on the march from Lahore toward Delhi
- Ahead of his arrival, Delhi had time to prepare
- But would they?

---

## Imad ul-Mulk's Desperate Situation

### His Weakness

**The Reality Check:**
- Imad **did not have a large army** in Delhi
- He **didn't have many friends** to depend on either
- His two potential allies:
  1. Najib Khan (Rohilla)
  2. Shuja-ud-Daulah (Awadh)
- But neither would help...

---

## The First Betrayal: Najib Khan's Refusal

### The Money Dispute

**What Happened:**
- Imad ul-Mulk asked **Najib Khan** for military help
- Najib demanded money first - to pay his soldiers' salaries
- **Bachabachi** (altercation, hostile back-and-forth)
- They had hot words and couldn't agree

**The Positions:**
| Person | Position |
|--------|----------|
| **Najib Khan** | "Pay me first, then I'll help" |
| **Imad ul-Mulk** | "Why should I give it to you?" |

**The Truth:**
- This was all just **excuses from Najib**
- He had **secretly invited Abdali to Delhi** in the first place
- He was never going to help Imad
- Imad understood this - he saw through the excuses
- But what could he do?

---

## The Second Disappointment: Surajmal Jat

### Why Surajmal Declined

**His Reasoning:**

1. **His only military interest:** Keep Marathas south of the Narmada River
2. **Didn't want to mess with Abdali** - why get involved?
3. **Had a small kingdom** - wanted to protect it
4. **Calculated:** If Abdali comes for Delhi, he probably won't bother with me

**His Logic:**
- Abdali's interest is **temporary** - loot Delhi and leave
- Marathas' interest is **permanent** - they want to stay and rule
- Better to let Abdali come, do his thing, and leave
- As long as I don't take **Panga** (enmity) with Abdali, I'll be fine
- **Why would I fight Abdali to protect the Mughals?**

**The Calculation:**
> "Abdali will loot and leave. Marathas are the real permanent threat. I'm staying out of this."

---

## Imad's Solo Defense Plans

### Making Preparations

**His Decision:**
- Realized he's on his own
- No help from Najib Khan
- No help from Surajmal Jat
- Started making preparations to **defend Delhi himself**
- Would fortify the outskirts

**His Strategy:**
- Prepare for battle on the outskirts of Delhi
- But also keep negotiation channels open
- Cover all bases if possible
- Hope for the best

---

## The Negotiation Attempts

### Attempt #1: Yaqub Ali Khan

**The Mediator:**
- **Yaqub Ali Khan** was Abdali's **Wazir**
- He actually resided in Delhi
- Imad asked Najib Khan to send Yaqub Ali Khan to Abdali
- Purpose: **Rapprochement** (negotiation, peace talks)
- Hope: Maybe buy some time, broker a deal

**Why This Made Sense:**
- Yaqub Ali had relationships with both sides
- Could potentially mediate
- Maybe prevent the attack

### Attempt #2: Mughalani Begum (The Trap)

**Imad's Misunderstanding:**
- Imad thought Abdali was coming **because he was angry about Mughalani Begum**
- Thought: "I displaced her from Punjab, so he's coming to rescue her"
- **Completely wrong** - Abdali was coming to loot
- But Imad didn't know about her secret letters

**His "Brilliant" Plan:**
- "Let me send Mughalani Begum to negotiate with Abdali"
- "If she asks him to go back, maybe he'll listen"
- "After all, he's here for her, right?"

**January 10, 1757:**
- Mughalani Begum left Delhi
- Supposedly to convince Abdali to turn around and go home
- **This was incredibly stupid** because:
  - SHE was the one who invited him in the first place!
  - She had written letters asking him to come!
  - Now she was going to tell him to leave? 
  - But Imad didn't know this - he was in the dark

---

## Mughalani's Triple-Cross

### The Meeting with Abdali

**What Happened:**
- She met with **Shahawali Khan** (Abdali's Wazir)
- She met with **Abdali himself**
- On the outskirts of Delhi

**Her Performance:**
- Pretended to do her job: "Please go back, blah blah blah"
- Just for show

**Abdali's Excuse:**
> "I can't go back now. I'm so close. How can I not pay my respects to the Mughal Emperor?"

**The Reality:**
- Complete lie
- His real aim: Get all the treasure out of Delhi
- He knew it wouldn't be given willingly
- **He'd have to dig it out**
- He'd have to go to rich houses
- He'd have to **torture people, kill them, take hostages**
- Whatever it takes to get the money

### Her Secret Message to Imad

**The Double-Cross:**
- She sent a **secret message back to Imad ul-Mulk**
- Her advice:

> "If you can't fight Abdali, just leave Delhi. Go hide somewhere. He's asked you to come meet him - that might be dangerous for you. If you can't fight, just let him come to Delhi and take what he wants. At least you'll be safe."

**Why She Did This:**
- She WANTED Abdali to loot Delhi freely
- She had invited him after all
- If Imad hides, Abdali has free rein
- She looks good in Abdali's eyes
- Classic betrayal

**Her Character:**
> "She has no principles. No loyalty to anyone. Only trying to protect herself and get the best outcome for herself."

## Abdali's Demands

### The Ultimatum

**What Abdali Demanded from the Mughal Emperor and Wazir:**

| Demand | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Province of Punjab** | Entire wealthy province |
| **Province of Multan** | Adjacent to Punjab |
| **Jammu & Kashmir** | The mountainous region |
| **2 crore rupees** | Massive cash payment |
| **Emperor's daughter** | Political marriage |

**His Promise:**
> "Deliver all this to me, and I'll go back without entering Delhi."

**Why These Demands:**
- Punjab, Multan, Kashmir = **Annual agricultural revenues**
- These areas were prosperous, fertile, advanced agriculture
- That's where the big money is
- These were **undisputed parts of Mughal Empire**
- Abdali was demanding massive territorial concessions

### The Impossible Choice

**The Problem:**
- Neither Imad nor the Emperor had 2 crore rupees sitting around
- They couldn't give up three major provinces without a fight
- **But they also couldn't fight**

**Their Only Option:**
- Beg and plead: "Please don't come to Delhi"
- Because they knew what would happen if he entered

**The Implications:**
- Severe massacre
- Torture
- Destruction of Delhi on a grand scale
- He'd dig up all the courtiers' houses
- All the Mansabdars' wealth would be taken
- He'd raid the Emperor's treasury itself
- Leave them in economic ruin
- The entire high society would be upturned

---

## The Military Movements

### Abdali Divides His Army

**The Geography:**
- **Yamuna River** flows on the western side of Delhi
- To get into Delhi from the west (Abdali's direction), you MUST cross the Yamuna
- Strategic chokepoint

**The Two-Pronged Approach:**

#### Prong 1: Jahan Khan
- Crossed the Yamuna
- Didn't go to Delhi
- Went to **Awadh** (Shuja-ud-Daulah's kingdom)
- **Kicked out the Maratha regiments** stationed there
- Came and sat in **Luni** (outskirts of Delhi)
- Very close now

#### Prong 2: Shahawali Khan's Army
- Reached **Narela**
- Had **skirmishes (Chakmak)** with Antaji Mankeshwar's Maratha forces
- **Twice they fought**
- **Marathas had to retreat both times**

**But Then:**
- On the way back, Marathas had another skirmish with an Afghan/Rohilla commander
- **This time Antaji won**
- Small victory for the Marathas

---

## Najib Khan's Continued Treachery

### The Double-Dealing

**Imad's Repeated Requests:**
- Once again, Imad ul-Mulk asked Najib Khan to fight Abdali's army
- Still operating under wrong assumptions
- Thought maybe Najib would help

**Why Najib Would Never Help:**

1. **He wanted Abdali's protection**
   - Abdali had a fearsome reputation
   - No way Najib wants to be his enemy

2. **He was Afghan himself** (Rohilla = Indian Afghan)
   - Saw Abdali as their champion
   - The only difference: Abdali was "proper Afghan," Najib was settled in India
   - But he identified with Afghans
   - His origins were Afghanistan anyway

**Najib's Games:**
- Doing negotiations with Jahan Khan about working together
- On the other hand, asking **2 crore rupees** from Imad to "protect" him
- **Double-dealing** - playing both sides
- Getting ransom from the Mughals
- They were his "piggy bank"

**His Strategy:**
- Give excuses not to do anything
- "OK, OK, I'll help. But give me this first."
- "Why don't we do this instead?"
- Never actually delivering
- Just stalling and extracting money

---

## The Final Betrayal

### Abdali's Message

**The Demand:**
- Abdali sent a message to Imad ul-Mulk
- **"Bring the Mughal Emperor to meet me"**
- This could be very dangerous
- Or he'd just demand massive amounts of money

### Najib's Open Switch

**The Moment of Truth:**
- **Najib Khan went with his army to Abdali**
- Openly joined him
- No more pretense
- Made his loyalty known publicly

**Why He Did It:**
- Najib knew Abdali was powerful
- Wanted to side with the powerful guy
- Not oppose him
- Self-preservation and opportunism
- Plus ethnic/cultural loyalty to Afghans

6. **The Multi-Front Siege** - Abdali surrounding Delhi from multiple directions
7. **The Reputation Effect** - Abdali's fearsome image prevents resistance
8. **The Torture Preview** - Everyone knows what's coming if he enters

---

## The Mughal Army's Decay

### Why They Didn't Resist

**The Reality:**
- Lost their morale
- Not battle-hardened anymore
- Become "loosey-goosey" - soft
- Didn't have the punch they used to
- **And they knew it**

**The Reputation Factor:**
- Abdali had a **fierce reputation**
- His army was feared across the region
- Mughal soldiers knew they couldn't win
- Didn't want to fight
- Took any excuse to get out

**The Result:**
- Easy defeats
- Quick retreats
- No will to fight
- The empire's military power was fiction

---

## Surajmal Jat's Logic

### The Neutral Strategy

**His Calculation:**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Abdali's goals** | Temporary - loot and leave |
| **Maratha goals** | Permanent - stay and rule |
| **His position** | Small kingdom to protect |
| **Risk from Abdali** | Low - just passing through |
| **Risk from Marathas** | High - they want permanent control |

**His Philosophy:**
> "Why would I fight Abdali to protect the Mughals? Let him come, loot, and leave. As long as I don't mess with him, I'll be fine. Marathas are the real problem."

**The Wisdom:**
- Sometimes neutrality is the smartest play
- Pick your battles
- Protect your own interests
- Don't die for someone else's empire

---

## The Cultural/Historical Notes

### Bachabachi (बचबाची)
- Hostile back-and-forth argument
- Not just discussion, but altercation
- Indicates serious disagreement
- No resolution possible

### Panga (पंगा)
- Enmity, conflict
- "Taking panga with someone" = making them your enemy
- Deliberately creating conflict
- Surajmal didn't want to take panga with Abdali

### The Yamuna River Strategy
- Natural defensive barrier
- Must be crossed to reach Delhi from west
- Strategic chokepoint
- Abdali crossed it with two armies from different points

---

## What Comes Next

**The Setup:**
- Delhi is surrounded
- Imad is isolated
- Najib has openly joined Abdali
- Mughalani has sabotaged negotiations
- Abdali's demands can't be met
- The Emperor is powerless
- **There's only one thing left to happen: Abdali enters Delhi**

**The Questions:**
1. Will Imad surrender or fight?
2. How will Abdali extract the wealth?
3. What will happen to the Mughal Emperor?
4. Where are the main Maratha forces?
5. Will anyone come to Delhi's rescue?
6. How much will Abdali loot?

---

## The Ironies

**Irony #1:**
- Imad sent Mughalani to negotiate peace
- She was the one who invited Abdali in the first place
- Classic move by someone who doesn't know what's really happening

**Irony #2:**
- Imad kept asking Najib for help
- Najib was actively helping Abdali
- Imad was basically asking his enemy for protection

**Irony #3:**
- Abdali claims he's just here to "pay respects" to the Emperor
- Everyone knows he's here to loot
- But the polite fiction must be maintained

**Irony #4:**
- Surajmal makes the smartest move (stay neutral)
- By not fighting for anyone, he protects himself
- Sometimes doing nothing is the best strategy

---

**January 1757: Delhi is surrounded. Abdali makes impossible demands. Najib openly betrays Imad. Mughalani sabotages from within. Surajmal wisely stays out. The Mughal army has no will to fight. The Emperor is powerless. The treasure map is in enemy hands. And "something very important is about to happen..." The fall of Delhi is imminent.**
