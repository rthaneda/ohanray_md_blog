## The Suggestion: Chase Him to Karnal (April 1757)

### The Tactical Opportunity

**The Proposal:**
> "In April, at least Raghunath Rao should follow up. Up until Karnal (in Punjab), Raghunath Rao should take the army and follow up or chase Abdali at least up until Karnal."

**Why:**
- Put **some kind of pressure**
- Create **some kind of scare**
- Show: "You've done bad things here"
- Don't let him leave peacefully

**The Strategy:**
> "He's suggesting that Raghunath Rao should be attacking Abdali's... the later part of here."

**Why It Could Work:**
- Abdali has **lots and lots of animals**
- Lots of **cavalry going back**
- If Raghunath Rao **gives him a chase in the back**
- Can create **trouble for Abdali**

**The Vulnerability:**
> "Abdali is now not in a fighting mode. He is getting out."

- **Not prepared for battle**
- Just trying to leave
- Vulnerable in retreat
- Perfect target

---

## The Guerrilla Tactic: QIG Strategy

### Hit and Run

**The Method:**
> "This is QIG's tactic: suddenly some 2, 3, 5 thousand people come and they try to rob this, because it's going to be a straight line that people are going. Try to attack them and suddenly disappear."

**The Strategy:**
- **Surprise attacks**
- Small forces (2,000-5,000)
- Attack the **straight column**
- **Rob/loot them**
- Then **suddenly disappear**
- Come back later, attack again

**Why It Works:**
> "If we were to give him trouble while he is getting out, it will look good on us and it will give us some good publicity."

**The Approach:**
- **Backward attacks**
- Not fighting in open field
- **Skirmish warfare**
- Attack for **1-2 hours**
- Then **vanish**
- Then **come back** later
- Never let them regroup

**The Formation:**
- Army traveling in **one straight line/column**
- Easy to **hassle**
- Hard for them to **defend whole length**
- Can't fight back effectively

---

## Why Raghunath Rao Refused

### The Calculation

**His Decision:**
> "Raghunath Rao did not accept this challenge."

**The Reason:**
> "Probably he didn't have capable army with him to carry out this kind of backward attacks."

**The Reality:**
- At this stage, Abdali had **fearsome reputation**
- Nobody wanted to **attack him lightly**
- Have to be **properly prepared**
- Need **good size of army**
- Otherwise **very dangerous**

**Abdali's Reputation:**
- **Experienced general**
- Not easy to go to war with
- Had this reputation **for a reason**
- Developed his **war machine** well
- All his looting **depended on army quality**

**The Risk:**
- Even in retreat, dangerous
- Could turn and fight
- Might destroy small force
- Better to let him leave

## Critical Insights

### The Maratha Self-Sabotage

**The Jat Problem:**
- Surajmal **ready to fight Abdali**
- **Would have been natural ally**
- But Marathas created **enmity**
- Now he considers them **enemies**
- **Won't help them**

**The Tragedy:**
- Could have united against Abdali
- Jats fierce warriors
- Local knowledge of terrain
- **Perfect allies**
- **Marathas drove them away**

**The Pattern:**
- Also drove away Rajputs (Amber, Jodhpur)
- They **invited Abdali in revenge**
- Marathas **creating their own enemies**
- **Diplomatic failures**

### The Missed Tactical Opportunity

**Why Chase to Karnal Made Sense:**

1. **Abdali vulnerable** - long column, not fighting mode
2. **Loaded with loot** - slow movement
3. **Thousands of animals** - hard to defend
4. **Getting out** - not expecting attack
5. **QIG tactics** - proven effective
6. **Good publicity** - show resistance

**Why It Would Have Worked:**
- **Skirmish warfare** (not open battle)
- **2-5k fighters** hit and run
- Attack **1-2 hours**, vanish
- Come back, attack again
- **Never let them rest**
- **Can't regroup** in column formation

**Why Raghunath Rao Refused:**
- Didn't have **capable army**
- Abdali's **fearsome reputation**
- Even in retreat = **dangerous**
- Risk of **being destroyed**
- Better safe than sorry

**The Cost:**
- Let him leave **peacefully**
- **No resistance shown**
- **No consequences** for invasion
- **Encouraged future raids**
- Missed chance for **small victory**

### The Forced Conversion & Marriage System

**The Scale:**
- **Many Hindu women** converted
- **Married into Afghan army**
- Royal princesses taken
- Creating **permanent bonds**

**The Purpose:**
- **Political alliances**
- **Legitimacy** for future claims
- **Hostages** essentially
- **Cultural conquest**
- Not just looting wealth, taking people

**The Impact:**
- Families destroyed
- Cultural trauma
- **Human trafficking**
- Forced conversions
- Religious violence

### The Animal Caravan

**The Scale:**
- **Thousands of elephants**
- **Bulls, horses, camels**
- All carrying loot
- Shows **magnitude of theft**

**The Logistics:**
- Needed that many animals
- Shows **organization**
- Shows **systematic planning**
- Not random looting
- **Calculated extraction**

### The Systematic Search

**The Method:**
> "Digging everywhere in the house."

- Nothing left
- **Total extraction**

- **Thorough** - found everything
- **Organized** - systematic approach
- **Intelligence** - knew where to look
- Left nothing behind

### The Regional Kings' Fear

**The Question:**
> "Who is our protector? (Party Rakha?)"

**The Reality:**
- Every small king **worried**
- **No strong protector** available
- Mughal Emperor = powerless
- Marathas = too far/scattered
- Abdali = could return anytime
- **Everyone vulnerable**

**The Implication:**
- Power vacuum
- Insecurity everywhere
- Need for strong power
- **Someone must fill vacuum**
- Or chaos continues

### The Rajput Invitation Theory

**The Claim:**
- **Amber and Jodhpur kings** invited Abdali
- **Revenge on Marathas**
- For creating enmity during succession disputes

**The Irony:**
- Marathas tried to **help** (mediate disputes)
- Instead **created enemies**
- Now Rajputs **invited invader**
- To hurt Marathas
- **Diplomacy failure** leading to disaster

**The Cost:**
- Entire North India suffers
- Because of **personal grudges**
- Regional politics → national catastrophe
- Short-term revenge → long-term disaster

### Sadashiv Rao Bhau's Introduction

## Foreshadowing

**What This Sets Up:**

1. **Abdali got away cleanly** - no resistance in retreat
2. **Natural allies alienated** - Jats and Rajputs hostile
3. **Diplomatic failures** have consequences
4. **Forces too dispersed** - can't act effectively
5. **Sadashiv Rao Bhau** being informed - future role coming
6. **Guerrilla tactics discussed** - will be important later
7. **Reputation matters** - fear of Abdali prevents action
8. **More suffering coming** - Delhi's bad luck continues
9. **12 crore stolen** - but will run out eventually
10. **He'll be back** - it's inevitable

**The Questions:**
- Will Marathas fix diplomatic mistakes?
- Will they unite with Jats against common enemy?
- Can they reconcile with Rajputs?
- Will forces be better organized next time?
- When Abdali returns, will they be ready?
- What role will Sadashiv Rao Bhau play?

**February-April 1757: Abdali's massive caravan heads home - thousands of elephants, bulls, horses, camels, all loaded with 12 crore rupees worth of loot. The Rohillas and Pathans escort him to the boundary like honored guests. Hindu women have been converted and married into the Afghan army. Royal princesses taken to Afghanistan. He dug up every house in Delhi looking for hidden wealth. Found it all. Someone suggests: "Chase him to Karnal! Hit him while he's vulnerable! Use guerrilla tactics!" The strategy makes sense - Abdali's in a long column, not fighting mode, loaded with loot, can't defend well. But Raghunath Rao says no. Doesn't have capable army. Abdali's reputation too fearsome. Too dangerous even in retreat. Let him go. Meanwhile, Surajmal Jat is ready to fight Abdali - but considers Marathas his enemies now. The Marathas drove him away with bad diplomacy. Same with the Rajput kings of Amber and Jodhpur - they're the ones who invited Abdali in the first place, for revenge on Marathas. Self-sabotage everywhere. And Sadashiv Rao Bhau is receiving letters now, being brought into the picture. More bad things are coming for Delhi. The suffering isn't over. And everyone knows: Abdali will be back.**
