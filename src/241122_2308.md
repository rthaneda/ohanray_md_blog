# Dattaji's Impossible Tasks: Rivers, Raghuji, & The Rajput Who Wrote to Abdali (1758-1759)
## The Inheritance Debt, The Pontoon Bridge Lies, & The Secret Letter That Changed Everything

---

## The Loan: An Inheritance

### "Rajya Kshama"

**What Nana Saheb Called It:**
> "**Rajya Kshama**" - something that is his father's inheritance portion.

**The Reality:**
- Loan was **staggering** on the Peshwa
- Continuously **growing**
- The **burden of loan**

**Where It Came From:**
- A lot of the loan was **outstanding**
- From the reign of **Bajirao I** (Peshwa)
- So Nana Saheb's **father**

**How He Thought About It:**
- Used to call it **"Rajya Kshama"**
- Something he **inherited**
- Like an **inheritance**
- But of **debt**, not wealth

---

## Dattaji's Campaign: The Objective

### Why He Was Sent North

**The Goal:**
> "Dattaji's campaign to the north - the objective was to **lessen the loan burden**."

**The Problem:**
- **Abdali's invasions** had made northern provinces **poorer**
- Revenue that Peshwa was getting from those provinces
- Becoming **smaller and smaller**
- Because there was **no capacity** for wealth generation

---

## The Only Hope: Bihar and Bengal

### Go East

**The Situation:**
- Northern provinces like **Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan, Awadh**
- The fertile land between Ganga and Yamuna
- These provinces had been **impoverished**

**The Only Chance:**
- To make money: basically go **east**
- Two provinces there:
  1. **Bihar**
  2. **Bengal**

**The Direction:**
> "That's where Peshwa was hoping to get money. That's why he told Dattaji Shinde to go **east** and **not waste his time** in Rajasthan or around Delhi or even Awadh."

**Who Is In Awadh:**
- **Shuja ud-Daula** is the Nawab
- Son of **Safdarjung** (who is dead)
- Shuja ud-Daula **still there**
- Will play **central role** in the future
- Makes a **huge difference**
- **Don't forget him**

**The Plan:**
- Whole idea was to go to **East**
- That was the direction given to Dattaji Shinde

---

## The Three Tasks

### What Dattaji Had to Do

**Before** Dattaji could go east:
- He had **several things to accomplish**
- Several **tasks**

**Task 1: Secure Punjab**

**Task 2: Knock Down [Najeeb Khan or enemy forces]**

**Task 3: Pass Through Awadh**
- Which is under control of [Shuja ud-Daula]

---

## The River Problem

### Why Marathas Struggled

**The Geographic Challenge:**
- When going towards **Bihar and Bengal**
- He has to **cross some rivers**

**If He's West of Yamuna:**
- Has to cross **Yamuna**
- Then has to cross **Ganga**
- Then there are some **minor rivers**

**Why It's Difficult:**
> "Crossing the rivers was **not a simple task** in those days. And Dattaji Shinde and specifically **Maratha army** was **not adapt** to the crossing of the rivers."

**When You Can Cross:**
- Only time you can cross them: **winter or summertime**
- **Monsoon** was **out of the question**

**Why:**
- Ganga and Yamuna are **huge rivers**
- Even **smaller rivers** that appear small in summer
- Become **three, four times big** in terms of width
- In the **monsoon**

**Translation:**
> "That is what he was **hampered** [by]."

---

## Najeeb's Pontoon Bridge Lie

### The Empty Promise

**The Technique:**
- **Najeeb** or **Najeeb ud-Daula**
- Had **mastered the technique**
- Of putting **pontoon bridges** across the river

**What He Promised:**
- Dattaji Shinde was **dependent on him**
- Najeeb kept telling him:
> "**I will help you, I will help you**"

**The Reality:**
- But he **never really had any intention** to help him

**When Shinde Realized:**
- Realized it **too late**
- That this guy **doesn't intend** to help me
- He just wants to **delay**
- Doing this help for me
- **Until it's too late**

**The Result:**
- He kept on **depending on this guy** Najeeb
- And it never materialized
- That kind of technique or help
- **Never materialized**

---

## Bengal: Already Under British Spell

### One More Thing

**The Situation:**
> "Now there was one more thing: Bengal was kind of **under the spell of British**."

**The Timing:**
> "While Peshwa was... it happened **right under his nose**."

---

## The Eastern Campaign Details

### What He Had to Do

**Go Through Awadh:**
- Which is **Shuja ud-Daula**

**Take Control of Patna:**
- Patna is important city
- Capital of **Bihar** (today's Bihar state)

**Keep Going East:**
- When you go even **east of Bihar**
- You get into **Bengal**

**Why:**
- That's where the **revenue or the money**
- Because **Abdali did not have the time**
- To go into **Bihar and Bengal**

**The Result:**
> "The riches in those states were still **more or less intact**."

**What Could Be Done:**
- They could be **looted**
- Or they could be **taken under control**
- Then you start getting the **taxes, revenue** and all that

---

## The Raghuji Bhosle Problem

### "Bengal Is Mine"

**Another Problem:**
- **Raghuji Bhosle** of Nagpur
- He considered Bengal as **his territory**
- Kind of to **loot**

**Why:**
- That was something they had **decided**
- Division of where they will **operate**
- Kind of an **unwritten agreement**
- "Okay, Raghuji Bhosle, you take over or you deal with **Bengal**"
- "We'll deal with **northern provinces** like Punjab and this and that"

**But:**
- Now Raghuji Bhosle was **dead**
- Within his sons, there was **problem**
- Who gets the **throne**

**What Peshwa Decided:**
- Peshwa had made up his mind
- We will **take over**
- Or at least go to **Bengal**
- And start getting the **riches** from there

**The Real Goal:**
- His immediate goal was **not** even to consolidate control
- He wanted to get his **loans paid up**

**Why:**
- He was doing all these campaigns
- **Not** to get more territory
- But to get the **money**
- To **pay off these loans**

**The Reality:**
> "He couldn't **afford** these battles because now they are **overstretched**."

---

## After 1758: Maratha Hegemony

### The Extent of Control

**What They Had:**
> "After 1758, almost **all of northern India** was under Maratha **control or hegemony**. Meaning they **didn't rule** it, but they were the **leading power**."

**The Problem:**
> "But to keep that control, hegemony, and yet go in Bengal - that was **not even possible** for a very **experienced and capable** commander like Dattaji Shinde."

**His Reputation:**
- Dattaji was a **very highly thought of commander**
- In Maratha, in Pune
- He was based **in and around the northern parts**
- He wasn't going **back and forth**
- Would just **stay in the north**

---

## Late 1758: Jankoji in Jaipur

### Collecting What's Owed

**What Happened:**
- End of 1758
- Jankoji went to **Jaipur**
- Madho Singh was there
- Jankoji made sure **whatever was owed** was given
- "Vasuli" = to make sure payment is collected

**The Deal:**
- Madho Singh had **promised** certain amount
- Jankoji made sure **that was paid**

**Then:**
- After that, both **Dattaji and Jankoji** went to **Delhi**

---

## Malhar Rao's Illness

### Recuperating

**What Happened:**
- At that time, **Malhar Rao Holkar**
- Had just was **recuperating**
- From a **serious illness**

**He Came to Pune:**
- Now he came to **Pune**
- Explained to Nana Saheb Peshwa
- Why he **could not accomplish certain goals**
- When he was in the north

**Why:**
- Maybe there was **criticism**
- That he didn't accomplish **enough**
- Also **money management** was important portion
- They thought that it **wasn't done well**

---

## Sent to Rajasthan

### Udaipur and Jaipur

**What Peshwa Did:**
- Then Peshwa sent him to **Rajasthan**
- Both to **Udaipur** (where we have been)
- And also to **Jaipur** (where Madhav Singh was based)

**The Goal:**
- So he can gather some of the **promised amounts**

---

## The Jaipur Wall Problem (1759)

### Entire Year Wasted

**The Challenge:**
- Because he could **not make much progress**
- In pressurizing **Madhav Singh**
- Who was in **Jaipur**

**Why:**
> "The simple reason was that Jaipur had this **big wall**. It was a **walled city** to protect people inside and the king and the palace and all that."

**The Reality:**
- Because of that, he couldn't do much progress
- Couldn't **get inside**
- Because all the doors were **closed**
- And **high walls**
- And **cannons** and all that

**The Result:**
> "He basically couldn't do anything. So **1759**, he just spent trying to see, make progress to get in, but that was not going to be because it had **protective cover**. He spent the **entire year**."

---

## Madhav Singh's Secret

### In Contact With Abdali

**What Was Happening:**
> "At that time, Madhav Singh was **in contact with Abdali**."

**Why:**
- To **screw over the Marathas**
- And **collaborate** on this

**The Background:**
- Madhav Singh and a couple of other **Rajput kings**
- Were **constantly being attacked** by the Marathas
- Rajput kings were constantly being **badgered**
- For paying **tributes** to Marathas

**The Problem:**
- They were in **deep trouble**
- Because their **revenue** probably was **not that high**
- And they probably had **committed giving big money** to Marathas

**Why They Promised Big:**
- Because they wanted to get their **Maratha help**
- They **promised big amounts**

**The Realization:**
- Once Marathas **delivered the goals**
- They realized: we have given them **too big a promise**
- In comparison, their revenue from taxes
- Or whatever else they had in their kingdom
- **Wasn't that high**
- Because you can't just start giving money **you don't have**

---

## The Constant Badgering

### Why Madhav Singh Hated Marathas

**The Pressure:**
- Marathas were **constantly badgering** them
- Especially **Madhav Singh**

**Why Marathas Did This:**
- Because Marathas, in turn
- Had to **pay their army soldiers**
- And get **supplies**
- And make it, if not profitable
- At least **even** venture

**The Harassment:**
> "But they were being **badgered**, the Madhav Singhs especially."

---

## Madhav Singh's Plan

### Bring Abdali to Drive Marathas South

**His Thinking:**
> "He thought: if **Abdali can come**, then he can **drive Marathas** back to the **south of Narmada**."

**Why:**
- This **constant harassment** will stop
- Because he wanted somebody to **weaken the Marathas**
- They don't bother him **all every now and then**

**His Weakness:**
- He himself was **weak**
- He **couldn't stand up** to Maratha army's might

**His Solution:**
> "He thought Abdali may **help him** beating Marathas to the south and he will be able to **leave** [them alone]."

---

## The Letter (1759)

### "When Are You Coming?"

**What He Did:**
- He wrote a **letter to Abdali**
- **1759**
- Basically must have said:
> "Hey, **when are you coming**?"

**Who Knew:**
- **Nobody** knew about it (anabhiknya = he didn't know)
- That this guy was **writing letter**
- And being in **correspondence** with Abdali
- He was totally in the **dark**
- Of course

**Why Secret:**
- Madhav Singh is **not going to tell Marathas**
- That I am writing to Abdali
- This was totally **secret**
- He was in the dark
- Didn't know what was going on

**The Assessment:**
> "So it was a **big conspiracy**."

---

## Following Abdali's Advice

### Creating Problems

**What Abdali Told Him:**
> "As per **advice he got from Abdali**, Madhav Singh didn't even waste **one possibility** to create **problems for Marathas**."

**The Execution:**
- Whichever way he could
- Create **problems for Marathas**
- He would **do it**

## Critical Insights

### The Inheritance of Debt

**"Rajya Kshama":**
- What a name
- Like calling cancer a "gift"
- **Inheritance** from father
- But it's **debt**
- Continuous **burden**
- Staggering, **growing**

**The Psychology:**
- Frames it as something **inherited**
- Not something he **caused**
- His father's **legacy**
- But he has to **deal** with it

---

### The Geographic Impossibility

**The Math:**
1. Keep **hegemony** over all northern India
2. Secure **Punjab** (northwest)
3. Knock down enemies (throughout north)
4. Pass through **Awadh** (center)
5. Go to **Bihar** (east)
6. Continue to **Bengal** (extreme east)

**The Reality:**
> "Not even possible for a very **experienced and capable** commander like Dattaji Shinde."

**Why:**
- Too many **fronts**
- Too much **distance**
- Not enough **forces**
- Geographic **spread** impossible

---

### The River Trap

**The Problem:**
- Marathas **not skilled** at river crossings
- Need **help**
- Depend on **Najeeb**

**Najeeb's Game:**
- Has the **skill** (pontoon bridges)
- **Promises** to help
- "I will help you, I will help you"
- **Never intends** to help
- Just wants to **delay**

**When Realized:**
- **Too late**
- Dattaji **dependent** on him
- Kept **depending**
- Never **materialized**

**The Trap:**
- Can't go east **without** crossing rivers
- Can't cross rivers **without** Najeeb
- Najeeb won't **help**
- Stuck

---

### The Only Hope Already Gone

**The Plan:**
- North = impoverished (Abdali)
- Go to **Bihar and Bengal**
- Riches **intact** there

**But:**
- Bengal **under British spell**
- Happened **right under Peshwa's nose**
- Battle of Plassey: **1757**
- This is **1758-1759**
- **Too late**

**So:**
- Only hope = **Bihar**?
- But have to **get there first**
- Rivers in the way
- Najeeb won't help
- Good luck

---

### The Raghuji Excuse

**The Claim:**
- "Bengal is **my** territory"
- **Unwritten agreement**
- Division of operations

**The Reality:**
- Raghuji is **dead**
- Sons **fighting**
- No one actually **operating** there
- British took it **anyway**

**Peshwa's Decision:**
- "We'll take it"
- Immediate goal: **not control**
- Immediate goal: **pay loans**

**The Truth:**
- Using Raghuji's death as **excuse**
- To break the **agreement**
- Because **desperate** for money

---

### The Walled City Problem

**1759:**
- **Entire year** outside Jaipur
- Can't get **inside**
- High walls
- Closed doors
- **Cannons**

**Malhar Rao:**
- Recovering from **serious illness**
- Sent there to collect **promised amounts**
- **No progress**
- Basically **couldn't do anything**

**The Waste:**
- Whole year **wasted**
- No money **collected**
- Meanwhile: **Madhav Singh** inside
- Writing **secret letters** to Abdali

---

### The Rajput Trap

**How It Happened:**
1. Rajput kings want **Maratha help**
2. **Promise big amounts** to get help
3. Marathas **deliver** the goals
4. Rajputs realize: **promised too much**
5. Their revenue **not that high**
6. Can't pay what they **don't have**
7. Marathas **badger** them constantly
8. Because Marathas need money to **pay soldiers**
9. Rajputs get **desperate**
10. Write to **Abdali** for help

**The Cycle:**
- Promise → can't pay → badgered → desperate → invite enemy

---

### Madhav Singh's Calculation

**His Situation:**
- **Weak** (can't stand up to Marathas)
- Being **badgered** constantly
- Can't pay what he **promised**
- Revenue **too low**

**His Solution:**
- Get **Abdali** to come
- Drive Marathas **south of Narmada**
- **Constant harassment** stops
- He can **breathe**

**The Letter:**
- "**When are you coming?**"
- Secret **conspiracy**
- Nobody knows
- Following **Abdali's advice**
- Creating **problems** for Marathas

**The Invitation:**
- Rajput king **inviting** Afghan invader
- To drive out **Hindu** Marathas
- Because of **money** pressure
- **Irony**: selling out to pay debts

---

### The Najeeb Strategy

**Why He Won't Help:**
1. Dependent on **Abdali**
2. **Interdependent** relationship
3. If Marathas get to **Bengal**
4. They get **money**
5. They get **stronger**
6. Can **threaten** Najeeb and Abdali

**The Delay:**
- "I will help you"
- But **never** do it
- Keep **delaying**
- **Until too late**
- Rivers can't be crossed
- Monsoon comes
- Have to **wait**
- By then: situation **changes**

**The Genius:**
- Simple **passive resistance**
- Just **don't help**
- They can't **force** you
- Because they **need** the skill
- Don't have it **themselves**

---

## Foreshadowing

### What's Coming

**The River Trap:**
- Dattaji **can't** cross rivers without help
- Najeeb **won't** help
- **Stuck** in the north
- Can't reach **Bihar/Bengal**
- Where the money is

**The Secret Letter:**
- Madhav Singh invited **Abdali**
- Nobody **knows** yet
- Following his **advice**
- Creating **problems**
- When will Marathas **find out**?

**The Impossible Task:**
- Keep hegemony **everywhere**

- Something will **break**

**The British in Bengal:**
- "Under the spell of British"
- Happened **right under Peshwa's nose**
- Too **late** now
- Hope for **Bihar** only?

**The Loan Math:**
- Need money from **east**
- But **can't get there** (rivers)
- Bengal **gone** (British)
- North **impoverished** (Abdali)
- Rajasthan **won't pay** (walled in Jaipur)
- Where's the **money** coming from?

**The Conspiracy:**
- Rajput king **inviting** Abdali
- To drive out Marathas
- **Abdali already planning** to come
- Now he has **local allies**
- The **invitation** is coming

**Shuja ud-Daula:**
- "Don't forget him"
- "Central role in future"
- "Makes huge difference"
- What will **he** do
- When Abdali comes?

---

**1758-1759: The loan Nana Saheb inherited from his father—"Rajya Kshama"—staggering, growing, burden. Dattaji's objective: lessen it. Go east. Bihar and Bengal. Only places with riches intact. Abdali didn't have time to go there. But to get there? Cross Yamuna. Cross Ganga. Cross minor rivers. Marathas not adapt to river crossings. Monsoon? Impossible. Rivers become 3-4 times bigger. Need help. Najeeb has the skill. Pontoon bridges. Promises: "I will help you, I will help you." Never intends to. Realized too late. Just delaying. Until too late. The trap. And Bengal? Already under British spell. Right under Peshwa's nose. Too late. Bihar only hope. But have to get there. Rivers in the way. Najeeb won't help. Meanwhile: Jaipur. Entire year wasted (1759). Malhar Rao outside the walls. Can't get inside. Walled city. High walls, closed doors, cannons. No progress. And inside those walls? Madhav Singh writing secret letters. To Abdali. "When are you coming?" Big conspiracy. Nobody knows. Being badgered by Marathas constantly. For tributes. Promised too much. Can't pay. Revenue too low. Wants Abdali to drive Marathas south of Narmada. Constant harassment would stop. Following Abdali's advice. Creating problems for Marathas. Whichever way he could. The invitation is being written. The conspiracy taking shape. And Dattaji? Tasked to keep hegemony over all northern India AND go to Bengal. Not even possible for experienced and capable commander like him. Geographic impossibility. The rivers. The British. The walls. The secret letters. The inheritance of debt. The task that can't be done.**
