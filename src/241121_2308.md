---

## The Bitterness Lessens

### Holkar-Shinde Rivalry

**What Happened:**
- Both Holkar and Jayapa Shinde were involved
- Both trying to **benefit** from battle of **two sons**
- To inherit the kingdom

- That carried on for **some time**

**The Competition:**
- Both appointed to **northern parts** of India

- How can you let this guy go?

---

## The Kota Meeting Effect

### Subduing the Bitterness

**What Happened:**
> "Between this meeting - Jankoji and Malhar Rao - their bitterness **somewhat subdued**."

**Why:**
- Jankoji being the **young guy**
- Relatively **not informed** about politics of the North
- Asked about his **opinions** and things like that
- About the **politics of Mughal North**

**Malhar Rao's Status:**
- Considered as **old, elderly personality**
- People kind of **respected** him
- Like his **father's age** or even a little older

---

## The Career Advice

### "Don't Kill Najeeb Khan"

**What Malhar Rao Said:**
> "**Don't try to bother** Najeeb ud-Daula, that Rohila guy."

**Why:**
- Partly because Malhar Rao wanted to **protect him**
- They had **special relationship**

**The Washing Clothes Metaphor:**

**Malhar Rao's Logic:**
> "If you **get rid of** Najeeb ud-Daula, then Peshwa will ask you to **clean the clothes on the banks of Ganga**."

**Translation:**
- Najeeb Khan is **big time enemy** of Marathas and Peshwas
- If you **kill him** or **get rid of him**
- Your **utility to Peshwa** will be **zilch**
- He won't **need you anymore**
- He will ask you to do **mundane** things
- Like washing clothes (profession where you wash and dry)

**The Analogy:**
> "If you are working for Ford and if you **display all your knowledge** to your employer, then would the employer **need you anymore**? No."

**The Logic:**
> "**Don't get rid** of this enemy of ours or Peshwa's enemy. Because if you do, **Peshwa won't need you anymore**. Keep him around so you can **show** that you are taking action, you are being of **help** to Peshwa, you are going after Najeeb ud-Daula. We **need him**."

---

## The Impact on Jankoji

### What He Thought

**The Reality:**
- Jankoji was a **young guy**
- We don't know what **impact** this logic had on Jankoji's mind

**But:**
- He would **not have taken action** on it anyway
- Because at the time, head honcho of Shinde family: **Dattaji Shinde**
- All **important decisions** will be taken by **Dattaji**
- Unless Dattaji **agrees** or has particular viewpoint
- That is what they will **implement**

**Translation:**
> "Telling Jankoji doesn't mean too much. He cannot take **independent action** unless Dattaji **agrees** with him."

---

## Dattaji's Role

### In Charge of the North

**His Position:**
- Basically in charge of **northern situation**
- Because Raghunath Rao came back
- From his campaign
- **Without putting any governance structure** in Punjab

**The Situation:**
- Punjab was **volatile**
- Contested territory between **Marathas and Afghans**
- Dattaji was given the **responsibility**
- To manage the affairs
- Make sure it's not **taken over again** by Abdali

---

## Malhar Rao: The Fox

### The Ulterior Motive

**Why the Advice Was Disingenuous:**
> "The old man was a **fox**."

**His Ulterior Motive:**
- He also had **ulterior motive**
- Because he considered Najeeb as his **Manusputra**
- **Manusputra** = adopted son (**Putra** = son)
- Wanted him to **not get killed**
- Wanted to **protect him**

---

## The Interdependence

### Najeeb Khan & Abdali

**Why Najeeb Needs Abdali:**
- Najeeb Khan **extremely afraid** of Maratha power
- Because they kind of unofficially **running the empire**
- He **cannot survive** in front of Maratha power
- So he **needs Abdali**

**Why Abdali Needs Najeeb:**
- From Abdali's point of view
- Najeeb ud-Daula is **extremely important**
- He **unlocks the India** for him
- He **needs him**

**The Bond:**
- Both are **Afghans**
- **Natural allies**
- They are **interdependent**

- Or felt **angry with himself**
- That he was **not able to get rid of Najeeb** then and there

**Why He Couldn't:**

- He **should have**, but he **didn't**

**The Reason:**

**The Cow Incident:**
- Najeeb started **killing cows** in front of him
- On banks of Ganga or Yamuna
- Raghunath Rao wanted to **go and attack** Najeeb ud-Daula
- But **Holkar said**: "Hold your horses. If you want to go kill him, you have to do it **over my dead body**."

**The Result:**
> "One thing or the other, he just was **stopped** from getting rid of Najeeb ud-Daula. Now looking back, he was feeling **upset with himself**. Why didn't he do it when he **had him in his hands**? But the moment was **gone**."

---

## The Letter to Jankoji

### Finish the Job

**What Raghunath Rao Did:**
- When he goes to Pune
- Writes a letter to **Jankoji**
- Says: **"Get rid of this man"**
- **Finish the job**

**Why Raghunath Rao Couldn't Do It:**

- Because Malhar Rao Holkar considered him as his **own son**
- Would **not allow** Raghunath Rao to take action

- Holkar was **older** than him
- Kind of **legendary** Malhar Rao commander
- Also had worked with his **father** (Bajirao I, who was Peshwa)

**The Age:**
- Even though Raghunath Rao was part of **ruling clan**
- Still didn't want to go **against** Malhar Rao Holkar's advice

- **Much younger**

**The Experience:**
- Holkar was always placed in the **north**
- Understood the **politics of the north**
- Raghunath Rao was mostly in **Pune** or thereabouts

---

## The Loan Balloons

### Rajya Kshama

**The Situation:**
> "The loan amount was **ballooning** on Peshwa's head by this time."

**What It Was:**
- Raghunath Rao had compiled **lot of loans**
- Then it was **increasing every month**

**From Bajirao I:**
- Lot of the loan was collected from **Bajirao I**
- Remember Bajirao I had done **lot of campaigns** to the north
- He needs money to go there
- With army of **10,000, 20,000 people**
- All that was **financed based on loans**
- Kind of collected over time
- All that was **still outstanding**
- Was becoming **too much, way too much**

**What Nana Saheb Called It:**
> "He used to give it some name (**Rajya Kshama**) but basically it was becoming **untenable**."

---

## Dattaji's Task

### Lower the Loan

**What He Was Given:**
> "The task that was given to Dattaji was to **lower down this loan**, which was now becoming **untenable**."

**Why:**
- Raghunath Rao **didn't do a good job**
- In terms of lowering the loan
- Because he **increased it actually**

---

## Why the North Was Impoverished

### Abdali's Impact

**The Important Reason:**
- Because Abdali has **sacked Delhi**
- And **neighboring areas**
- **Twice or thrice**
- As a result, whole thing was **impoverished** in the north

**What Was Lost:**
- Lots and lots of **riches in Delhi** alone
- But because he has **sacked** it two, three times
- The **revenue** that Marathas were getting from north
- Had **dwindled**

**What Marathas Lost:**
- Marathas would have been **happy to sack it themselves**
- So they couldn't get it from **payments or by looting**

---

## Before Abdali: Nadir Shah

### The Barbarians

**The Timeline:**
- Whole thing had become **totally impoverished**
- Because of **Abdali**
- And before that, before Abdali even
- **1739**, there was the **king of Iran**
- **Nadir Shah**

**Who They Were:**
> "They basically were **barbarians**."

**The Comparison:**
> "Marathas were **not as barbarians** as these people. They had a **little bit of humanity**."

**The Methods:**
- Once they understood
- Some of the stories during Abdali's invasions
- He would **torture people**
- Make sure he would get **all the money**
- Wherever it was **hidden**
- That was the **barbarian side**

**The Marathas:**
- **Weren't so keen on that**
- Not that barbaric
- But most of the riches were **gone**

**The Emperor:**
- Mughal emperor himself was **poor** for the people
- They took **horses, elephants, bullock carts, everything**
- Just **took it away**
- He had **nothing left** or not much

---

### The Career Logic

**The Argument:**

2. You're here to fight big enemies
3. If you eliminate big enemy

---

### Why It Works on Jankoji

**He's Young:**
- Only **19-20 years old**
- Not informed about **northern politics**
- Asking for **opinions**
- **Respects** elders

**Malhar Rao's Status:**
- **Old timer** (50s)
- Worked with **Bajirao I**
- Father's age or **older**
- People **respect** him

**The Advice Sounds Wise:**

---

### But It Doesn't Matter

**The Reality:**
- Jankoji can't take **independent action**
- **Dattaji** is head honcho
- All important decisions = **Dattaji**
- Telling Jankoji = **doesn't mean too much**

**So Why Tell Him?**
- Plant the **seed**
- Maybe he influences **Dattaji**
- Or at least he **won't push** to kill Najeeb
- **Passive protection** of Najeeb

---

### The "Over My Dead Body" Regret

**What Happened:**
- Raghunath Rao **about to attack** Najeeb
- Cow slaughter incident
- Malhar Rao **physically stopped** him
- "Over my dead body"

**Why He Backed Down:**
1. **Respected** Malhar Rao
2. Malhar Rao **older** (Raghunath Rao only **25**)
3. Malhar Rao worked with his **father**
4. Malhar Rao = **legendary** commander
5. Understood **northern politics** better

**The Regret:**
> "Now looking back, feeling **upset** with himself. Why didn't he do it when he **had him in his hands**? But the moment was **gone**."

**The Letter:**
- Returns to Pune
- Writes to Jankoji

- But will Jankoji?

---

- Before that: **Nadir Shah (1739)**
- Riches are **gone**

**The Task:**
- Dattaji: **lower the loan**
- But **how**?
- Where's the **money** coming from?

**The Irony:**
- Raghunath Rao was supposed to **lower** it
- He **increased** it instead
- Now Dattaji has to **fix** it
- With even **fewer resources**

---

### The Barbarian Comparison

**Nadir Shah & Abdali:**
- **Barbarians**
- **Torture** people
- Get **all the money** (wherever hidden)
- No humanity

**Marathas:**
- **Not as barbaric**
- Had **little bit of humanity**
- Weren't so keen on **torture**

**But:**
- Marathas would have been **happy to loot**
- Just not **as brutally**

- Barbarians got there **first**

- "Over my dead body" stopped him
- **Moment is gone**
- Will Jankoji (or Dattaji) **succeed** where he failed?
- Or will history **repeat**?

---

**1758-1759: The fox gives his advice. Malhar Rao Holkar meets young Jankoji Shinde (19-20 years old) at Kota. The bitterness between their families lessens. And then the old man speaks: "Don't kill Najeeb ud-Daula. If you do, Peshwa won't need you anymore. Your utility will be zilch. He'll ask you to wash clothes on the banks of Ganga. Keep your enemy alive - it's job security." Fox logic. Career advice. But the real reason? Malhar Rao considers Najeeb his adopted son. Wants to protect him. The advice is disingenuous. The ulterior motive clear. Meanwhile, Raghunath Rao in Pune writing letters full of regret: "Kill Najeeb. Finish the job." Because he had his chance. 1758 in Delhi. Najeeb slaughtering cows. Raghunath Rao about to attack. But Malhar Rao stopped his horse. "Over my dead body." And Raghunath Rao backed down. Respected him. Old timer. Worked with his father. Only 25 himself. Now looking back: upset with himself. Had Najeeb in his hands. The moment is gone. And the loan? Ballooning. From Bajirao I's campaigns. From Raghunath Rao's campaigns. Increasing every month. Becoming untenable. Nana Saheb calls it "Rajya Kshama." Dattaji tasked to lower it. But how? The north is impoverished. Abdali sacked Delhi 2-3 times. Nadir Shah before him in 1739. Barbarians. Torture. All the money gone. Nothing left to loot. And Najeeb? Needs Abdali (protection from Marathas). Abdali needs Najeeb (unlocks India). Interdependent. Natural allies. Both Afghans. The fox protects his adopted son with clever advice. The young commander doesn't know it's disingenuous. But it doesn't matter. Jankoji can't act independently. Dattaji decides. And Dattaji has his orders.**
