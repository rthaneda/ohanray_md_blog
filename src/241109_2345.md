# Abdali's Departure & The Afghan-Maratha Rivalry Setup (1757)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Retreat Suggestion (March 1757)

### Attack the Rear?

**The Proposal:**
- Someone (possibly Antaji Mankeshwar) suggested to **Raghunath Rao Peshwa**
- Strategy: Attack **Abdali's rear columns** as he retreats
- **Guerrilla tactics** - hit the supply train
- Raghunath Rao **declined**

**Why He Refused:**
- Probably didn't have **adequate army** to execute
- Abdali had developed a **fearsome reputation**
- Not something to undertake lightly
- Needed proper preparation and sufficient numbers

---

## The Dispersed Maratha Forces (March 17, 1757)

### Letter from North India

**Who Was Where:**

| Commander | Location | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Antaji Mankeshwar** | Agra | With Naroshankar and Samsher Bahadur |
| **Naroshankar** | Agra | |
| **Samsher Bahadur** | Agra | |
| **Malhar Rao Holkar** | Rampur | With Rajashri Dadasaheb |
| **Rajashri Dadasaheb** | Rampur | Identity unclear |

**The Problem:**
- Forces **could not be assembled**
- Too dispersed
- Not enough strength to confront Abdali
- Had to let him leave

---

## The Massive Loot (March 26, 1757)

### Badrinath's Account

**From One Fort Alone:**
- **20 lakh rupees** looted
- Significant wealth from just one location

**The Scale of the Haul:**
- **28,000 animals** loaded with loot
  - Camels
  - Elephants  
  - Wolves
  - Bulls
  - Horses

**Cities Completely Looted:**
- **Delhi** - totally drained
- **Agra** - completely looted
- **Vrindavan** - stripped bare
- Bled them dry

**Even the Animals Were Stolen:**
- Merchants used donkeys/animals for transport
- Abdali even **took the pack animals**
- Needed them to carry his loot
- Nothing left behind

---

## The Weapons Haul

### What He Took, What He Left

**Left Behind:**
- **Cannons** brought to attack Surajmal Jat's fort
- No space on animals (prioritized loot over cannons)
- Abandoned the siege weapons

**Took With Him:**
- **All swords found in Delhi**
- **Cannons from the Red Fort** (Badshahi Killa)
- Best weapons he could carry

**Why Weapons Mattered:**
- War was his **business model**
- Needed **superior war machine** to keep looting
- Latest equipment = winning battles = more loot
- Investment in future invasions
- Would be back again and again

---

## Mughalani Begum: The Betrayed Conspirator

### The Woman Who Got Nothing

**What She Did:**
- Provided **treasure map** to Abdali
- Told him where all the hidden wealth was
- Invited him to loot Delhi
- Expected reward

**What She Got:**
- **Deceived by Imad ul-Mulk** (no reward)
- **Deceived by Abdali** (no reward)
- Nobody gave her anything
- Both sides used her, then discarded her

### Her Fate

**The Retirement:**
- Rejected the small pension offered
- Moved to **Lahore**
- Lived in **dejection**
- Totally disheartened
- All her schemes came to nothing

**The Punishment:**
- **Jahan Khan** (Abdali's commander) **beat her**
- For her **arrogance**
- Humiliated by the very people she helped

---

## The Sikh Resistance Begins

### Attacks on the Column

**What Happened:**
- On the way back to Afghanistan
- **Sikh warriors attacked** Abdali's columns
- Abdali was most **vulnerable** while traveling
- Army in a **long line formation**
- Perfect target for hit-and-run attacks

**Why Sikhs Were Effective:**
- Gave Abdali **tough times**
- Harassed his retreat
- Not a major army yet, but growing

### The Sikh Organization

**Their Structure:**
- Small armies: **200-500 fighters** each
- **Separate leaders** for each band
- **Not united** into one force
- **Disorganized** overall
- But militaristic and fierce

**Why They Were Militarizing:**
- Being **persecuted by Muslims** in Punjab
- Had to **defend themselves**
- Out of necessity, not choice
- Reform movement → warrior community

**The Hindu Problem:**
- Hindus in Punjab were **not battle-ready**
- Not warlike people
- **Sikhs provided the resistance** to Muslims
- Filled the military vacuum

---

## Abdali's Revenge: Destroying Holy Sites

### The Retaliation

**What He Destroyed:**
- **Kartarpur** - Sikh holy site
- **Amritsar** - Sikh holy site (Guru's doors destroyed)

**Why:**
- **Revenge** for Sikh attacks on his retreat
- Had to go through Punjab to reach Afghanistan
- Deliberately **desecrated sacred places**
- Sent a message

**The Pattern:**
- Sikhs attack → Abdali retaliates by destroying temples
- Violence escalating
- Religious conflict intensifying

---

## Taimur Shah: The Governor of Punjab

### Abdali's Son Stays Behind

**The Appointment:**
- **Taimur Shah** (Abdali's son) became **Subedar of Lahore**
- Based in **Lahore** (capital of Punjab)
- Left to control the province
- Abdali's way of holding Punjab

**The Resistance Continues:**
- Sikhs **gave Taimur tough times**
- He was staying, they were local
- Constant harassment
- Ongoing struggle for control

**Abdali's Goal:**
- Abdali would cross Punjab and go to Afghanistan
- But wanted **son controlling Punjab**
- His only territorial ambition (for the tax revenue)
- Rest of India = just for looting

---

## The Lasting Impact of 1757

### What People Remembered

**The Atrocities:**
- **Massacres in Mathura** (Hindus slaughtered)
- **Massive looting** of wealth
- **Temple destruction** throughout the region
- **Total devastation**

**The Psychological Damage:**
- Very **distressing attack**
- Not something people would **forget easily**
- Burned into collective memory
- Trauma lasting for generations

---

## The Power Structure After Abdali Left

### Who Got Control

**Najib Khan's Reward:**
- Abdali gave **government controls** to **Najib Khan**
- His loyal Rohilla follower
- Now in strong position

**The Reality:**
- **Mughal Emperor** - namesake only, powerless
- **Wazir** - very weak
- **Najib Khan** - strong position but...
- **Rohilla forces** - only **10-15,000 soldiers**

**The Problem:**
- 10-15k was **no match for Marathas**
- Neither in **numbers**
- Nor in **war tactics**
- Nor in **valor**
- Rohillas were outclassed

---

## The Maratha Return

### Filling the Vacuum

**During Abdali's Presence:**
- Marathas had **totally dispersed**
- Tactical retreat
- Couldn't face him directly
- Waited him out

**After He Left:**
- Started **coming back**
- Re-establishing **hegemony** in North
- **Total vacuum** of power
- Emperor weak, wazir weak
- Najib Khan insufficient
- **No big dog in town**

**The Maratha Advantage:**
- Superior in every way to Rohillas
- Natural candidates to fill power vacuum
- Expanding empire northward
- Picking up where they left off

---

## The Great Rivalry: Afghans vs. Marathas

### Two Powers, One Target

**The Setup:**
- 1757 invasion **set up this rivalry**
- Both wanted **North India**
- Both knew it was the **money purse**
- Both had ambitions to control it

### The Afghan Perspective

**What They Wanted:**
- **Punjab** - only territorial goal (for taxes)
- **Delhi** - to loot periodically  
- **No permanent rule** - just raid and leave

**Why They Needed India:**
- **Afghanistan had nothing**
- No riches, no money
- To get wealth = come to India
- Delhi and nearby areas = where the money was
- **Business model:** periodic raids

**Their Status:**
- **Foreigners to India**
- Afghanistan = separate country
- Could come and go (no visa requirements)
- **Invaders**
- Even recognized as such at the time

### The Maratha Perspective

**What They Wanted:**
- Expand empire northward
- Control North India permanently
- Collect tributes and taxes
- Build proper administration

**Their Advantage:**
- **In their own country**
- India was their home
- Not foreigners
- Not invaders
- Natural claimants to Mughal successor status

**The Money Problem:**
- Constantly needed **funds**
- Couldn't conquer North without money
- Armies need salaries
- Equipment, horses, supplies
- Had to keep raising funds

---

## The Critical Difference: Foreign vs. Domestic

**The Contrast:**

| Factor | Marathas | Afghans |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Origin** | Indian | Foreign (Afghan) |
| **Goals** | Permanent rule | Periodic raids |
| **Territory** | All of North India | Only Punjab |
| **Administration** | Build systems | Don't care |
| **Intent** | Stay and govern | Loot and leave |

**Why This Mattered:**
- Afghans would come and go
- Marathas would stay
- Made the conflict inevitable
- One had to win, one had to lose
- Stage set for confrontation

---

## The Book's New Section

### Part Two Begins

**The Title:**
- **"Khanda Don: Grishma"**
- Volume/Part Two
- "Grishma" (meaning unclear - possibly "summer"?)

**The Implication:**
- Major section break
- New phase of the story
- The rivalry phase
- Building toward confrontation

- **Attaq** (disputed)
- **Peshawar** (border area)
- **Lahore** (through Taimur Shah)
- **Punjab** (contested with Sikhs)

**Maratha Control:**
- **Deccan** (home base)
- **Central India** (traditional areas)
- **Attempting:** North India, Delhi area

**No Control:**
- **Delhi** - weak emperor, weak wazir, Najib Khan insufficient
- **Transition Zone** - up for grabs

---

## The Business Model Comparison

### Abdali's Model

**The Cycle:**
1. Invade India when need money
2. Loot Delhi systematically  
3. Take maximum wealth
4. Return to Afghanistan
5. Build Afghan empire with Indian loot
6. **Repeat when funds run low**

**The Sustainability:**
- Punjab = steady income (keep it)
- Delhi = one-time scores (raid periodically)
- Model worked multiple times
- Will continue working

### Maratha Model

**The Strategy:**
1. Conquer territory
2. Build administration
3. Collect regular taxes/tributes
4. Reinvest in army
5. **Expand further**

**The Challenge:**
- Need money to conquer
- Need to conquer to get money
- Chicken and egg problem
- Constant fundraising

## Critical Insights

### Why Raghunath Rao Declined the Rear Attack

**The Calculation:**
- Abdali's reputation was **fearsome**
- His army was **experienced**
- His general skills were **proven**
- He was **dangerous even in retreat**

**What Would Be Needed:**
- **Properly prepared** force
- **Good-sized army**
- Can't attack "lightly"
- Risk of being destroyed

**The Guerrilla Option:**
- Suggested strategy: **Skirmish warfare**
- **Pounce, create trouble, vanish**
- Attack for 1-2 hours, then disappear
- Come back, attack again
- **Don't fight open battle**
- Harass the column repeatedly

**Why It Could Work:**
- Army in column formation (vulnerable)
- Can't regroup easily when marching
- Supply train exposed
- Not a fair fight (that's the point)

**Why Raghunath Rao Still Refused:**
- Still needed capable army
- Even guerrilla warfare has risks
- Didn't have the forces available
- Better to let him leave

### The Sikh Evolution

**From Religious Reform → Warrior Community:**
- Started as reform of Hinduism
- Guru Nanak simplified theology
- "One God" message
- Reduced Brahmin importance

**Why They Militarized:**
- **Persecution** by Muslims forced it
- Had to defend themselves
- Became warriors out of necessity
- Now a force to be reckoned with

**Their Growing Organization:**
- Still in early stages (1757)
- Small bands, separate leaders
- Not unified yet
- But fierce and effective
- Attacking Abdali shows confidence

### The Power Vacuum Problem

**Everyone Too Weak:**
- Mughal Emperor = powerless
- Wazir = ineffective
- Najib Khan = only 10-15k (insufficient)
- No single power could control North

**Who Could Fill It:**
- **Only Marathas** had the strength
- But they were in the Deccan (far away)
- Distance made control difficult
- Would have to build presence

**The Opportunity:**
- Vacuum won't last forever
- Either Marathas fill it
- Or Abdali keeps raiding
- Or someone else rises
- But status quo unsustainable

---

## The Weapons Priority

**What Abdali Kept:**
- Red Fort cannons (best ones)
- All swords from Delhi
- Latest military technology

**What He Left:**
- Cannons used against Jat fort
- Too heavy to transport
- Prioritized loot over all weapons

**The Logic:**
- War machine = future income
- Must stay superior
- Latest weapons = winning battles
- Winning battles = more loot
- Investment in the business

---

## Foreshadowing

**What This Sets Up:**

1. **Abdali will return** - just a matter of time
2. **Marathas will expand north** - filling vacuum
3. **Sikhs will grow stronger** - organizing resistance  
4. **Najib Khan insufficient** - can't hold North
5. **Collision inevitable** - two powers, one target
6. **Money problem persists** - Marathas need funds
7. **Punjab remains key** - both sides want it

**The Question:**
- When Abdali returns (not "if")
- Will Marathas be ready?
- Will they have money?
- Will they have forces in place?
- Or will it be 1757 again?

---

**March 1757: Abdali leaves India loaded with loot, 28,000 animals carrying treasures, weapons, everything he could grab. Sikhs harass his retreat. He destroys their holy sites in revenge. His son Taimur stays in Lahore as governor. Marathas start creeping back into the vacuum. Najib Khan holds Delhi with insufficient forces. The stage is set. Two powers want the same territory. One is foreign and just wants to raid. The other is domestic and wants to rule. The rivalry has begun. The collision is inevitable. The only question is when.**
