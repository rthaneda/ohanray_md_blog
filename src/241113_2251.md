## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

## The Geography Lesson: Rivers and the Doab

### Understanding the Landscape

**Old Delhi's Location:**
- Completely on the **western side of Yamuna bank**
- Had to **cross the river** to get to Doab

**The Doab Region:**
- Area **between Ganga and Yamuna** (shown in orange on map)
- **Very, very fertile land**
- "**Do**" = two
- "**Ab**" = water/river
- **Doab** = land between two rivers

**Where the Rivers Meet:**
- They meet in the **south-east**
- NOT as far as Bengal
- Town called **Prayagraj** where they meet

**The Third River:**
- Third river: **Saraswati**
- Now **totally underground**
- Used to be there **~4,000 years ago**
- Today only **two rivers visible**
- But still called Prayagraj (three-river meeting)

---

## Why the Yamuna River is Important

### Strategic Barriers

**The Challenge:**
> "In those days there is no way to cross rivers during the monsoons. Even otherwise also it was not easy for an army."

**Even in Summer/Low Tide:**
- Still difficult for **big army**
- Armies have:
  - **Elephants**
  - **Horses**
  - **Bullock carts**
  - **Camels**
- When monsoon is **full blown**
- How do you cross with **all these animals and big cannons**?

**The Problem:**
- **Big challenge**
- **No bridges** existed
- Rivers act as **deterrent**
- Natural **barriers**

**The Tributaries:**
- Some rivers come and **meet with Yamuna**
- From the south
- **Chambal River** comes and meets Yamuna
- Several rivers come together to become **Chambal**
- Many tributaries even for one tributary

**Going Forward:**
> "That's why it's important. These rivers are going to play an important part going forward."

---

## The Urban Geography

### Delhi and Agra

**The Layout:**
- **Delhi** - on western flank of Yamuna
- **Agra** - to the **south of Delhi**
- Agra ALSO on **western flank of Yamuna**
- Close enough to Doab but **not technically in it**
- On the western side

**Where Rivers Start:**
- In the **Himalayas** (way up in mountains)
- When they start: **very small**
- As they enter the plains:
  - Slowly get **speed**
  - A lot of **flow increases**
  - Become **bigger and bigger**

**After They Meet:**
- Once they meet at Prayagraj
- Becomes **Ganga** (consumes the Yamuna)
- Keeps flowing toward **east**
- Finally empties into **Bay of Bengal**

**Today's Delhi:**
- To connect old Delhi with east-west: **bridges exist**
- Across Yamuna
- Most of Delhi **still on western flank**
- **Old Delhi** is what's really bordering the Yamuna
- **New Delhi** kind of to the **northwest** of normal Delhi

**Neighboring Countries:**
- **Nepal** visible on map
- **Bangladesh** to the east

## The Kutub Shah Raid (Flashback)

### Creating the Rift

**What Happened:**
> "Because Mr. Imad went against Mr. Najib Khan, his teacher or his guru decided to teach a lesson to Imad."

**The Raid:**

- **Treated all the women** of household badly
- Complete violation

**The Result:**
- **Najib Khan** was once his **subordinate**

---

## The Holkar-Najib Relationship

### Why This Worked

**The History:**
> "This is a very important thing. Because they were on good terms."

**Their Relationship:**
- Relations were **good earlier also** (before all this)
- Holkar had a **soft corner** for Najib Khan
- Najib Khan had a **soft corner** for Holkar
- **Reciprocated** relationship

**Najib's Character:**
> "Najib Khan was a very shrewd human being."

- **Wanted to use** this relationship
- To **get off easy**
- Strategic manipulation

**The Pattern:**
- In general, all these **Rohillas** (especially Najib Khan)
- **Literally hated Marathas**
- But for **Holkar**?
- **Treated softy** (made an exception)
- And same thing **reciprocated by Holkar**

---

## Najib's Plea to Holkar

- Najib Khan came into **Holkar's tent**
- Gave him a **big sum of money**

**The Request:**
- Raghunath Rao and Imad were **upset with him**
- Begged Holkar to **ask them to forget his follies**
- "You deal with these guys"
- "Convince them they should **let me go softly**"
- "Please fight on my behalf"
- "Tell them they should **pardon me**"

---

## Najib's Four Promises

### The Deal

**Point 1:**
> "Whatever you order me, I will behave accordingly. You have done a lot of good things to me, so I acknowledge that. You have been benevolent to me."

**Point 2:**
- Will **return** whatever areas
- That **Marathas had won** in the Doab area

**Point 3:**
- **Not to ever dabble**
- Into the **politics of Mughal court in Delhi**
- Won't upset the order

**Point 4 (Implied):**
> "I will return once I have made up my mind."

- Gave the **assurance** he'd behave
- Promise not to interfere

---

## The Reality: Najib's True Nature

### A Shrewd Politician

**The Assessment:**
> "But you know, he was a very shrewd politician."

**The Situation:**
- He was in a **very tight spot**
- Wanted to **get out**
- Could have been **as bad as losing his life**
- Could have been **killed**
- Found **guilty of treachery** against Mughals

**The Ploy:**
> "So he wanted to get out of it so he just could have played a ploy."

- "Oh, **please, please forgive me**"
- Maybe that's what he was doing
- Just **bidding for time**
- **Waiting to fight another day**

---

## Najib's True Intentions

### The Big Plan

**His Real Intent:**
> "Obviously he hated Marathas. I mean, he just said that one way or the other I'm going to evict these people from here."

**His Ambitions:**
- He himself had **big ambitions**
- Knew that **Marathas are the only force** that can stop him
- They were the **threat to be eliminated**

**Two Reasons to Oppose Marathas:**

1. **Political:**
   - Had **ambitions**
   - Wanted to be **big boss** in Mughal areas
   
2. **Religious:**
   - Was a **Jihadi Muslim**
   - Just didn't want **Marathas there at all**
   - Marathas were **Hindus**
   - Couldn't **tolerate them**
   - Thought Northern India **belonged to the Muslims**

**His Compromise:**
- Could make **peace with Mughal Emperor**
- Could accept **Mughal system of governance**
- But **not with Marathas**
- That was a **bridge too far**
- Because of his **Jihadi mindset**
- True **extremist**

**The Strategy:**
- Because he was **weak**
- Willing to **surrender for a while**
- Would be **patient and wait**
- Willing to say **whatever they wanted to hear**

---

## Najib's Trump Card

### The Abdali Connection

**His Big Ploy:**
> "His big ploy was to make sure Abdali comes back. That was his ace in the hole."

**Why He Needed Abdali:**
- Couldn't fight with **Marathas on his own**
- His **army size** insufficient
- Overall **resources** not enough
- **Not a match** for Marathas

**The Plan:**
- Just going to do **bidding**
- **Bid for time**
- Wait for **Abdali's return**
- **Abdali was his big daddy**

---

## The Escape

### Holkar Gives Safe Passage

**What Happened:**
- Najib Khan could have become **prisoner** of Raghunath Rao
- But because in **good terms with Holkar**
- Finally **Holkar helped him** get out of Delhi
- Gave him **safe passage**
- That's what **let him escape**

**The Sweet Talk:**
- Basically gave his **word**
- "I won't **meddle in your affairs**"
- "You know **I'm your slave**"
- "All the **lies**"
- "Let me go"

**Holkar's Trust:**
- Because he thought he had **great relationship**
- Gave him the **safe passage out of Delhi**
- Trusted the promises

**The Result:**
- Najib Khan took his **army**
- Left Delhi
- Went toward his area of the **Rohilkhand**

---

## Holkar's Power Move

### Installing New Government

**What Holkar Did:**
- Put his **men in the Delhi court**

**The Context:**
- Remember: **Abdali had come** few months earlier
- Basically put his **people in charge** in court
- Najib Khan was there as **Mir Bakshi**
- And blah blah blah

**The Change:**
- Now **Holkar changed all that**
- Put people who were **friendly to Marathas**
- And **Imad** and everyone again
- Complete **power shift**

---

## The Transfer of Authority

### Raghunath Rao Takes Command

**The Salute:**
> "So all of them went into Raghunath Rao's tent and they saluted him."

**The Result:**
- Basically, **Marathas now completely got control** of Mughal court
- **Ultimate authority** was Raghunath Rao Peshwa

**The Hierarchy:**
- **Holkar** still didn't have the ultimate authority
- **Raghunath Rao** was representing **Nanasaheb Peshwa**
- Because he was his **brother**
- Had some **authority level** that Holkar could not bring

---

## Grant Duff's Assessment

### The British Historian's View

**Who He Was:**
- **Grant Duff** = British historian

**What He Wrote:**
> "Najib Khan could have been imprisoned by Raghunath Rao. But no other Maratha leader was more powerful than Malhar Rao Holkar."

**The Reality:**

- Because **good terms with Holkar**
- Finally **Holkar helped him** get out of Delhi

**Why It Worked:**
- Gave him a **safe passage**
- Said all the **sweet words**:
  - "I won't meddle in your affairs"
  - "I'm your slave"
  - "All the lies"
- Let him go

---

## The Test Ahead

### Holkar's Abhay (Protection)

**The Grant of Life:**
> "Holkar gave Abhay to Najib. Abhay means giving the lease on his life."

**The Prediction:**
- How far this **Abhay** would hold
- Going to be **tested**
- **Kasoti** = test

**The Outcome:**
> "Just within a couple of years, Najib Khan is going to completely behave exactly opposite."

**What's Coming:**
- Going to **throw it back** in Maratha's face
- Create **big troubles** for Marathas
- So-called **hand jay for being slave**
- All that talk going to be **completely vaporized**

**The Reality:**
- Just meant to **get out of tough situation**
- Had **no intention of keeping his word**
- Was in **tough spot**
- **No Abdali around**
- Would be on **good behavior for a while**

**The Moment:**
- **Moment he got opportunity**
- Would **go back**
- Try and **expel them by however means**
- Intent was to **kill Marathas**
- **Expel them out of Northern India**

---

## The Cow Slaughter Incident

- That's where Marathas' tent was
- Najib Khan's tent

**What Raghunath Rao Saw:**

## Critical Insights

### The Geography Lesson's Importance

**Why They Taught This:**
- Rivers will be **crucial** going forward
- Act as **natural barriers**
- No way to cross during **monsoon**
- Even otherwise **difficult** for armies

**The Strategic Reality:**
- **Elephants, horses, camels** can't swim rivers easily
- **Big cannons** can't be ferried
- **Bullock carts** can't cross
- **No bridges** exist

**The Doab's Value:**
- **Very, very fertile**
- Between two rivers (irrigation)
- **Wealth of the region**
- Worth controlling

**The Flow:**
- Start **small** in Himalayas
- Get **bigger** in plains
- Meet at **Prayagraj**
- Become **Ganga**
- Empty into **Bay of Bengal**

### Holkar's Fatal Mistake

**The Decision:**
- Give **safe passage** to Najib
- Based on **personal relationship**
- Soft spot for each other
- **Reciprocated** affection

**Why It's a Mistake:**
- Najib is **shrewd politician**
- Just **playing for time**
- Has **no intention** of keeping word
- **Hates Marathas** (except Holkar)
- Will **betray** within couple years

**The Prediction:**
> "Just within a couple of years, Najib Khan is going to completely behave exactly opposite. Going to throw it back in Maratha's face. Create big troubles."

**Grant Duff's Warning:**
- Even British historian noted
- **Holkar most powerful** Maratha leader
- But his **personal feelings**
- Override **strategic necessity**
- Should have **imprisoned** Najib
- Or **killed** him
- Instead: **let him go**

### Najib's Two-Front Strategy

**Against Marathas:**

1. **Political Reason:**
   - Has **big ambitions**
   - Wants to be **big boss** in Mughal areas
   - Marathas **only force** that can stop him
   - Must **eliminate the threat**

2. **Religious Reason:**
   - **Jihadi Muslim**
   - Thinks **Northern India belongs to Muslims**
   - **Can't tolerate** Hindus (Marathas)
   - **Religious extremism**
   - True **extremist**

**His Acceptance:**
- Can make **peace with Mughal Emperor** ✓
- Can accept **Mughal system** ✓
- But **NOT with Marathas** ✗
- That's a **bridge too far**
- **Ideological** line he won't cross

### The Abdali Card

**Najib's Trump:**
> "His big ploy was to make sure Abdali comes back. Abdali was his big daddy."

**Why He Needs It:**
- **Can't fight Marathas** on his own
- **Army size** insufficient
- **Resources** not enough
- **Not a match**

**The Strategy:**
- **Bid for time**
- Be **patient**
- Wait for **Abdali's return**
- Then **strike**

**The Reality:**
- Right now: **no Abdali around**
- So: **good behavior for a while**
- But **moment he got opportunity**
- Would **go back** on promises
- **Expel Marathas** by any means

### The Cow Slaughter Provocation

**What Happened:**
- Najib slaughtering **cows** in his tent
- **Blood and meat** along path
- Right where Raghunath Rao **taking dip** in Yamuna
- **Unholy sight**

**Why It Matters:**
- Hindus are **devout**
- **Cannot allow** cow slaughter
- Deeply **offensive**
- **Religious violation**

**Holkar's Intervention:**
- Tried to **explain** to Najib
- "This disturbs **Hindu sensitivities**"
- "These people are **Hindus**"
- "**Cow is holy**"
- "Don't do this"

**Najib's Refusal:**
> "No, I'm not going to stop cows slaughtered."

**The Deliberateness:**
- Najib **knows** what he's doing
- This is **provocation**
- Testing boundaries
- **Religious warfare**
- **Won't compromise** even when asked

**Raghunath Rao's Response:**
- Was **irate**
- Decided to use **violence**
- To solve this situation
- About to escalate

### The Cow's Historical Significance

**The Post-Ice Age Role:**
- When humans **emerged from caves**
- Started **exploring**
- Used **cow** for:
  - **Transportation** (ride it)
  - **Food** (drink milk)
  - **Exploration** (go places)

**The Perfect Animal:**
- **Tamable** (could control)
- **Mobile** (could travel)
- **Self-sustaining** (eats plants)
- **Provides food** (milk)
- **Don't need to carry supplies**

**The Wealth Measure:**
- **Number of cows** = wealth
- More cows = **richer**
- Every family **counted** cows
- Status symbol

**The Sacred Status:**
- Never **forgot** its importance
- Essential to **prosperity**
- Essential to **survival**
- Therefore: **don't kill cows**
- Became **holy**

**Why It Endures:**
- Deep **historical memory**
- **Cultural** significance
- **Religious** protection
- Goes back **thousands of years**

### The Power Transfer Complete

**What Happened:**
- **Marathas control** Mughal court
- **Ultimate authority**: Raghunath Rao
- All officials **saluted** him

**The Hierarchy:**
- **Raghunath Rao** = ultimate authority
  - Representing **Nanasaheb Peshwa**
  - He's the **brother** (family connection)
  - Authority **Holkar can't match**
- **Holkar** = powerful but not ultimate
  - Most **powerful Maratha leader** (Grant Duff)
  - But still **subordinate** to Peshwa family

**The Installation:**
- **Holkar's men** in Delhi court
- **Friendly people** to Marathas
- **Friendly** to Imad
- **Changed** Abdali's appointees
- Complete **power shift**

### The Eid Ceasefire

**What They Did:**
- **August 27-28** = Eid celebration
- Maratha **stopped battle** for two days
- **Complete ceasefire**

**Why:**
- To cater for **Muslim feelings**
- During their **festival**
- **Respect** for religious observance
- **Strategic** tolerance

**The Irony:**
- Showing **respect** for Muslim festival
- While **besieging** Muslim-controlled city
- **Political** calculation
- **Win hearts** even while winning war

### The Test of Abhay

**What Abhay Means:**
- Giving the **lease on life**
- **Protection granted**
- **Safe passage**
- **Trust**

**The Prediction:**
> "How far this Abhay would hold... going to be tested (kasoti). Just within a couple years, Najib Khan is going to completely behave exactly opposite."

**What Will Happen:**
- **Throw it back** in face
- **Create big troubles**
- **All that talk** (being slave)
- Completely **vaporized**

**Why:**
- Just meant to **escape**
- **No intention** of keeping word
- In **tough spot** (no Abdali)
- Good behavior **temporary**
- **Waiting** for opportunity

**The Betrayal Coming:**
- Intent to **kill Marathas**
- **Expel** them from North
- **Jihadi** mindset
- **Ambitions** for power
- Will use **Abdali** when he returns

---

## Foreshadowing

**What This Sets Up:**

1. **Najib will betray** - within couple years
2. **Holkar's mercy** - will be fatal mistake
3. **Abdali will return** - Najib's ace in hole
4. **Cow slaughter** - religious violence escalating
5. **Raghunath Rao irate** - about to use violence
6. **Marathas control Delhi** - but for how long?
7. **Najib in Rohilkhand** - regrouping, waiting
8. **Jihadi extremism** - ideological war
9. **Rivers as barriers** - will matter in battles ahead
10. **Grant Duff's warning** - Holkar's power and mistake
11. **The Abhay test** - will fail spectacularly
12. **Two years** - that's the timeline for betrayal

**The Questions:**
- How will Najib betray them?
- When will Abdali return?
- Will Raghunath Rao attack over cow slaughter?
- Can Marathas hold Delhi without Najib threat?
- Will Holkar regret his mercy?
- How will rivers affect coming battles?
- What troubles will Najib create?

**August-September 1757: Geography lesson first - rivers are natural barriers, no bridges, can't cross during monsoon, Doab is the prize. August 10: Marathas attack Delhi. By end of August: complete siege, nothing in or out. August 27-28: ceasefire for Eid, respecting Muslim festival. September 3: Najib Khan surrenders. But he's shrewd - pleads to Holkar, "Consider me your son." Gives big sum of money. "I'm your slave. I won't meddle. I'll return the Doab." Holkar has soft spot for him - reciprocated relationship. Gives safe passage. Grant Duff warns: "Holkar most powerful Maratha leader" but this is a mistake. Because Najib is jihadi extremist, has big ambitions, hates Marathas, waiting for Abdali's return - "his big daddy." Within couple years will betray everything, throw it back in their face, create big troubles. Najib escapes to Rohilkhand. Holkar installs friendly people in Delhi court. All authority transfers to Raghunath Rao. Then cow slaughter incident - Najib doing it right where Raghunath Rao bathing in Yamuna. Holkar begs him to stop - "disturbs Hindu sensitivities." Najib refuses: "No, I'm not stopping." Raghunath Rao irate, about to use violence. The test of Abhay is coming. It will fail.**
