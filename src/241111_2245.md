## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Second Campaign Begins

### Seema Ullanghan: Boundary Crossing

**The Tradition:**
- **Seema** = boundary
- **Ullanghan** = to cross
- **Seema Ullanghan** = crossing your kingdom's boundary to wage war

**The Timing:**
- After **monsoon is over** (around October)
- After **Dasara festival** is celebrated
- When **harvest season** is complete
- **October 1756** - Raghunath Rao prepared to go north

**Why After Dasara:**
- Harvest is done
- Farmers are free
- Ground is dry (not muddy from monsoon)
- Rivers are crossable
- Traditional war season begins

---

## Meeting at Indore (February 6, 1757)

### The Commanders Unite

**What Happened:**
- **Malhar Rao Holkar** met/joined with **Raghunath Rao** at **Indore**
- Indore is around where you cross the **Narmada River**
- Holkar brought his troops
- Combined forces heading north

**The Timing Problem:**
- **At the same time** (February 1757)
- Abdali was **destroying temples** in Mathura
- **Killing people**
- **Taking away women**
- Massacring civilians

**The Distance:**
- Raghunath Rao and Holkar were still **hundreds of miles away**
- Too far to help
- Couldn't reach in time

---

## Why They Couldn't Face Abdali

### The Resource Problem

**Raghunath Rao's Situation:**
- **Lacked resources**
- **Lacked manpower**
- Not enough to **clash with Abdali**
- **Not possible** to go to battle with him

**Who Had to Fight:**
- **Antaji Mankeshwar** and his forces
- **Jawahar Singh** (Surajmal's son)
- **Some others**
- They offered **whatever little resistance** they could

**The Reality:**
- **Not really enough forces** to battle Abdali
- Did **whatever they could**
- But it **was not enough**
- Simply **not prepared**
- **Not enough numbers**

---

## The Rajasthan Detour

### Collecting Tributes

**Where They Went:**
- Instead of Delhi, went to **Rajasthan** (to the west)
- Purpose: **Get tributes**
- Collect **promised payments**
- Raise funds for campaign

**The Strategic Avoidance:**
- Raghunath Rao knew Delhi situation
- **This was his second time** north
- **Experienced commander**
- Understood **politics of North**
- **Wise enough** not to fight losing battle
- Avoided Abdali while he was there

---

## Raja Keshav Rai's Letter (April 30, 1757)

### The Eyewitness Report

**Who He Was:**
- **Seven generations** served in Mughal court
- **Well-wisher of Marathas** (hitachintak)
- Had **detailed insight** about what's happening
- **Good understanding** of developing situations
- Understood **likely future** events

**What He Wrote:**

- Comprehensive description

---

## The Cholera & Abdali's Departure

### Why He's Leaving

**From Keshav Rai's Letter:**
> "It is said that Abdali is trying to depart because his troops are getting sick because of different epidemics that are coming."

- **Cholera outbreak**
- Troops getting sick
- Forcing retreat
- Natural disaster helping India

---

## Najib Khan's Elevation

### The Wazir's Former Servant

**Who He Was:**
- Former **servant of the Wazir**
- **Nobody** in the Mughal Empire
- Low-ranking position

**What Happened:**
- As soon as **Abdali came to Delhi**
- Najib Khan got himself **Mir Bakshi position**
- **Forced the Emperor** to appoint him
- Because he was **very close confidant of Abdali**

**Why It Mattered:**
- Abdali wanted him **higher in Mughal camp**
- Reward for **loyalty**
- Reward for **inviting Abdali** to Delhi
- Among those who invited him (like Mughalani Begum)

**His Power:**
- Has **15,000-20,000 troops**
- Emperor now **totally dependent** on Najib Khan
- Will do **whatever Najib Khan says**
- Emperor has **no force of his own**

---

## The Pathan Problem

### The Warning

**From Keshav Rai's Letter:**

**The Spread:**
> "There is no area where there are no Pathans."

**Two Accounts:**
1. **Abdali's forces** are present
2. **Najib Khan and Rohilla commanders** (all Pathans)
   - Came and settled in India
   - Ancestry goes back to Pathan tribe

**The Hatred:**
- These Pathans **hate Hindus a lot**
- Even **Lahore, Multan** (Punjab cities)
- Earlier: inherent part of Mughal Empire
- Now: **full of Pathans as well**

**The Advice:**
> "We have to control the Pathan forces that are trying to intrude into the Mughal Empire. Otherwise they will take over most of North India."

---

## The Assessment of Mughal Strength

### How Weak Are They?

**The Reality:**
- Emperor has **no force**
- Nothing to command
- Even if **all Mughal forces collected or unified**
- Still **Abdali will be superior** to them
- No comparison

---

## Addressing Raghunath Rao

### "Maharaj Pratapi Ahith"

**The Respect:**
- Keshav Rai calling Raghunath Rao **"Maharaj"**
- Writing letter to him directly
- Addressing him respectfully

**The Message:**
> "You have to take into consideration what is happening in the North and act accordingly. But we have to tell you what is going on for sure. It is our duty."

**The Tone:**
- **Not being yes men**
- Being **straight** with him
- **Honest assessment**
- Duty to inform
- **Good counsel**

---

## The Timing: April-May 1757

### Abdali Leaves, Marathas Arrive

**The Sequence:**

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| **April 1757** | Abdali went back to Afghanistan |
| **May 1757** | Marathas arrived in **Agra** |

**Why They Waited:**
- Probably busy in **Rajasthan collecting tributes**
- Waited until Abdali was **well on his way to Afghanistan**
- Didn't want to be in Agra **while Abdali was there**
- **Purposefully came after** the fact

**The Calculation:**
- Knew their **numbers and resources** insufficient
- Didn't want to **butt heads** with him
- If they had the force, would have **gone much earlier**
- **Avoided confrontation** intentionally
- Raghunath Rao **experienced commander**
- Understood the **politics of North**
- **Wise decision** not to fight losing battle

---

## Shuja-ud-Daulah: The Awadh Problem

### Abdali's Instructions

**What Happened:**
- **Shuja-ud-Daulah** = Awadh Nawab (son of Safdar Jung)
- As per **Abdali's instructions**
- **Bangash and other people** opened front against him

**Why:**
- He didn't like him
- Or he didn't cooperate with Abdali
- Now being targeted
- Strategizing against him

---

## Sakharam Bapu Arrives (June 1757)

### The Diplomat from Pune

**Who He Was:**
- One of the **diplomats from Pune**
- Worked for **Nanasaheb Peshwa**

**What He Did:**
- Reached **near Delhi** in **June 1757**
- **Waited** for Raghunath Rao's arrival
- Not ambushing
- Just meeting under good conditions
- Coordinating arrival

---

## Manaji Paigude: Securing Delhi

### The Cannons at the Gates

**What He Did:**
- Manaji Paigude = **Maratha commander**
- Put **cannons at some gates of Delhi**

**Why Gates Mattered:**
- Delhi during Mughal period had **several gates**
- **Gated city** with walls
- Only a few **entry points**

**The Strategy:**
- Should not be **easy to get into inner city**
- If outside army tries to come
- Can be **withheld outside**
- Delhi not protected by **natural mountain**
- Needed **strategic defense**

**The Buffer:**
- Gates created **buffer zone**
- Didn't want enemy reaching **gates of Red Fort**
- Enemy waits at **gates of Delhi** (outer)
- **Defense in depth**

**Today:**
- Old Delhi was **smaller area** to encircle
- Now if you go to Delhi, **all gates removed**
- But once upon a time, critical defense

---

## The Imperial Dilemma

### Shuja-ud-Daulah's Proposal

**What He Asked:**
> "Shuja-ud-Daulah asked Marathas to do: fight with the Mughal Emperor."

**The Maratha Response:**
- Thought it's **not right** to fight emperor
- He's the **central power**
- **That's who they've been hired to protect**
- And that too for **king of a province** (vassal)?
- Doesn't seem right to **switch allegiance**

**The Problem with Shuja:**
- He was literally a **Vassal king**
- On behalf of the Mughals
- Should have had **loyalty toward Mughal Emperor**
- That's how **arrangements were struck up**
- But instead trying to **resist him**
- Things were **that bad** now
- Willing to **challenge even the emperor**

---

## Why Marathas Refused

### The 1752 Treaty

**The Backstory:**
- Marathas had **struck a deal** with Mughal Emperor
- Just **five years ago** in **1752**
- Got **victories on behalf of emperor**
- Received certain **provinces** and their tax income

**The Calculation:**
- Didn't want to **go back on that**
- Didn't want to **jeopardize gains**
- Would lose **everything they had gained**
- Provinces, tax income, all of it

**The Strategic Choice:**
- **Shuja-ud-Daulah** only **nabab of smaller kingdom**
- Didn't have **any loyalty to him**
- Emperor = bigger prize
- Shuja = not worth it

**The Decision:**
- "We are **not going to get into this mess**"
- Stay out of internal power struggle
- Maintain alliance with emperor

## Geography

**The Route:**
- **Pune** → **Indore** (cross Narmada) → **Rajasthan** (detour for tributes) → **Agra** → **Delhi**

**Key Locations:**
- **Indore** - where Holkar joined Raghunath Rao
- **Rajasthan** - where they collected tributes (west)
- **Mathura** - where Abdali was massacring (they were too far away)
- **Agra** - where they arrived in May 1757
- **Delhi** - ultimate target, gated city

**The Distance Problem:**
- **Hundreds of miles** from Indore to Mathura
- Too far to help during massacre
- By time they could reach, too late

---

## Key Themes

1. **Strategic Avoidance** - Wait out Abdali rather than fight him
2. **The Resource Problem** - Never enough forces/money
3. **Diplomatic Mistakes** - Alienating potential allies
4. **The Tribute Mission** - Money always the primary concern
5. **Seema Ullanghan Tradition** - Formal war season timing
6. **The Pathan Threat** - Taking over North India
7. **Najib Khan's Rise** - From servant to Mir Bakshi
8. **Wise Counsel** - Keshav Rai's honest assessments
9. **The Treaty Trap** - Can't betray 1752 agreement
10. **Cholera Saves India** - Natural disaster drives Abdali out
11. **Defensive Preparations** - Cannons at gates
12. **The Vassal Problem** - Shuja wants them to fight emperor

---

## Critical Insights

### The Strategic Avoidance Decision

**Why Raghunath Rao Avoided Abdali:**
- **Second time north** - experienced now
- **Understood politics** of the region
- Knew his **resources insufficient**
- **Wise enough** not to fight losing battle
- Better to **stay alive** and wait

**The Cost:**
- Couldn't help during **Mathura massacre**
- **Hundreds of miles away** in Rajasthan
- Collecting tributes while people died
- Pragmatic but **tragic**

**The Justification:**
- If they fought and lost
- **No Maratha presence** in North at all
- Better to **preserve forces**
- Live to fight another day
- **Strategic retreat** vs. suicidal charge

### The Seema Ullanghan Tradition

**Why October:**
1. **Monsoon over** - rivers crossable
2. **Harvest done** - farmers available (60% of army)
3. **Ground dry** - not muddy
4. **Dasara celebrated** - traditional timing

**The Military Calendar:**
- **October-April** - fighting season
- **May-September** - monsoon, can't campaign
- **Agricultural cycle** dictates war
- **Part-time army** needs farmers free

### Raja Keshav Rai: The Inside Man

**Why He Mattered:**
- **Seven generations** in Mughal court
- **Insider knowledge**
- **Detailed insight** into politics
- **Well-wisher of Marathas** (not just informant)
- **Honest assessment** - not yes man

**His Value:**
- Told them **truth about Pathan threat**
- Warned about **Najib Khan's power**
- Explained **Mughal weakness**
- **Strategic intelligence** from the inside
- **"It's our duty to tell you"** - commitment to truth

### The Najib Khan Elevation

**The Transformation:**
- From **servant of wazir**
- To **nobody**
- To **Mir Bakshi** (high position)
- **Totally dependent emperor** on him

**How It Happened:**
- **Invited Abdali** to Delhi
- **Very close confidant** of Abdali
- **Abdali forced** emperor to appoint him
- Reward for **loyalty and conspiracy**

**The Result:**
- **15,000-20,000 troops**
- Emperor has **no forces** of his own
- **Real power** in Najib's hands
- **Puppet master** situation

### The Pathan Takeover

**The Warning:**
- **No area without Pathans** anymore
- **Abdali's forces** present
- **Rohilla settlers** (Najib Khan's people)
- Even **Lahore, Multan** (Punjab) full of them
- **Taking over North India**

**Why They Hate Hindus:**
- **Jihadi mentality**
- See North India as **Muslim territory**
- **Religious extremism**
- Not just political, **ideological war**

**The Threat:**
> "We have to control the Pathan forces... otherwise they will take over most of North India."

### The Shuja-ud-Daulah Dilemma

**His Proposal:**
- Fight the **Mughal Emperor** for me
- I'm the Awadh Nawab
- Help me against the center

**Why Marathas Refused:**
1. **Not right** to fight central power
2. **Hired to protect** emperor, not fight him
3. **Just made treaty** in 1752 (5 years ago)
4. Would **lose all gains** (provinces, taxes)
5. Shuja only **vassal king** (small kingdom)
6. **No loyalty owed** to him
7. Emperor = **bigger prize**

**The Irony:**
- Shuja **should be loyal** to emperor
- That's the **arrangement**
- But things **so bad** now
- Even **vassals challenging** emperor
- Shows **total collapse** of authority

### The Gates of Delhi

**Why They Mattered:**
- Delhi **not naturally protected** (no mountains)
- Needed **artificial defenses**
- **Walls and gates** created
- **Few entry points** only
- **Buffer zone** strategy

**The Defense:**
- Enemy stopped at **outer gates**
- Keeps them **away from Red Fort**
- Can **hold them outside**
- **Defense in depth**
- Manaji Paigude: **cannons at gates**

**Today:**
- Gates **all removed** now
- **Old Delhi** was smaller, enclosed area
- Modern Delhi much larger
- But historically, gates critical

### The Tribute Problem

**Why They Went to Rajasthan:**
- Need **money** constantly
- **Armies cost** money
- **Salaries, equipment, supplies**
- **Tributes = income source**
- Have to collect or go broke

**The Tragedy:**
- While in Rajasthan **collecting money**
- Mathura being **massacred**
- **Hundreds of miles away**
- Money-focused while **people dying**
- Pragmatic but **morally costly**

**The Dilemma:**
- **Can't campaign without money**
- **Can't get money without campaigning**
- **Rock and hard place**
- Desperate situation
- Unpopular result

### The 1752 Treaty Anchor

**What They Got:**
- Certain **provinces**
- Their **tax income**
- **Legal recognition**
- Fighting **on behalf of emperor**

**Why It Matters:**
- **Just five years ago**
- Still **recent agreement**
- Can't **betray it** now
- Would **lose everything**
- **Foundation of position** in North

**The Constraint:**
- Can't fight **against emperor**
- **Locked into** central alliance
- Limits **flexibility**
- But provides **legitimacy**

---

## Foreshadowing

**What This Sets Up:**

1. **Najib Khan's power** - now Mir Bakshi, 15-20k troops
2. **Pathan threat** - taking over everywhere
3. **Emperor weakness** - dependent on Najib, no forces
4. **Cholera drove Abdali out** - not military defeat
5. **Raghunath Rao learning** - second campaign, more experienced
6. **Keshav Rai's warnings** - Pathan takeover coming
7. **Gates being fortified** - preparing for siege?
8. **Alliance with emperor** - locked in due to 1752 treaty
9. **Shuja-ud-Daulah hostile** - refused his proposal
10. **Money still problem** - always need more
11. **Arrived after Abdali left** - still avoiding confrontation

**The Questions:**
- Will they confront Najib Khan?
- Can they control the Pathan spread?
- Will Shuja-ud-Daulah become enemy?
- When will Abdali return?
- Will they be ready next time?
- Can they establish permanent presence?

---

**October 1756 - May 1757: Raghunath Rao leads his second campaign north after Dasara. Joins with Holkar at Indore in February. But while they're in Rajasthan collecting tributes, Abdali is massacring Mathura - hundreds of miles away, too far to help. Cholera drives Abdali out in April. Marathas arrive in Agra in May, purposefully after he's gone - don't have the forces to face him. Raja Keshav Rai sends detailed reports: "Pathans everywhere. Najib Khan elevated from wazir's servant to Mir Bakshi. Has 15-20k troops. Emperor totally dependent on him. They're taking over North India. You have to stop them." Shuja-ud-Daulah wants Marathas to fight the emperor. They refuse - "Not right. We have a treaty from 1752. We fight for the emperor, not against him. You're just a vassal." Sakharam Bapu arrives in Delhi in June. Manaji Paigude puts cannons at the gates. The stage is set. Najib Khan is powerful. The Pathans are spreading. And the Marathas are locked into their alliance with a powerless emperor.**
