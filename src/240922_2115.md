# Safdar Jung's Fall & The Attempted Coup
## The Final Confrontation, The Conspiracies, and The Desperate Power Play

---

## Quick Recap: The Situation in 1753

**The Power Structure:**
- **Abdali** demanded 50 lakh rupees from Delhi
- **Wazir (Safdar Jung)** asked Marathas for help
- This was **not** previously agreed upon - Abdali was **threatening them**
- Actually, some payments HAD been agreed (especially by Mir Manu)
- But Mir Manu's initiative, probably unofficial

**The Treaty Terms:**
- Between Emperor and Abdali (Marathas weren't party to it)
- Nevertheless, **Marathas were bound** by their own treaty
- Their treaty: protect Delhi if Abdali attacks

---

## The Conspiracy Against Safdar Jung

### Udham Bai's Revenge Plot

**The Trigger:**
- Udham Bai (Queen Mother) had gotten **angry**
- Because **Javed Khan** was killed by Safdar Jung
- Remember: she had a scandal-relationship with Javed Khan

**Her Allies:**
- Sought help from **sons of Kamruddin Khan** (previous wazir)
- But NOT from Mir Manu (one of those sons)
- Mir Manu was already in Lahore
- Also sought help from **Imad ul-Mulk** (the Mir Bakshi)

**The Irony:**
- Imad ul-Mulk = the co-conspirator that Safdar Jung raised as his own
- Now he's willing to **sell him out**
- Ungrateful and traitorous

---

## The Maratha Presence at Court

### The Representatives

**Why They Were There:**
- Marathas now had **representatives in the Emperor's court**
- They had **regular presence** because:
  1. They were **protectors** (per the treaty)
  2. They had established themselves as a **power to reckon with**

**Their Role:**
- Part **spy**
- Part **keeping in touch** with what's happening in northern Indian belt
- Keeping aware of developments

**The Status:**
- They'd **earned their place** on the court

---

## Antaji Mankeshwar: The Maratha Commander

### Who He Is

**His Position:**
- A **commander or warrior**
- Has probably **2,000-5,000 force** under him
- Administrative role, but **not a clerk**
- Military commander with troops

### His Analysis

**What He Thought:**
- A lot of people were **conspiring against Safdar Jung**
- This situation is going to get into some **bloody battle**
- That was Mankeshwar's prediction

---

## The Key Players Assembling

### Who Matters Now

**The Most Important:**
1. **Abdali** - The external threat
2. **Bhau** - [A new character entering the story]

**Always in the Picture:**
- **Nana Saheb Peshwa** - Directing from Pune

**Coming Soon:**
- Peshwa will **send his son** from Pune
- His name: **Vishwasrao**
- Will enter the picture a little later
- **Will play a decisive role in the very end** (foreshadowing!)

**Still to Enter:**
- There's **one more character** that has to enter the picture
- Still waiting to be introduced

---

## The Build-Up to Conflict (Month 1752 → 1754)

### The Escalation

**What Started Happening:**
- In the month of 1752
- Army movement started in Delhi
- Really started looking like there was going to be **anarchy**

**Why:**
- **Emperor vs. Wazir**
- Their relations getting from **bad to worse**

### The Two Camps

**Emperor's Camp:**
- Had **bribed Mankeshwar** (the Maratha commander)
- So **Marathas were on the side of Emperor**

**Wazir's Camp:**
- **Madhav Singh** (Rajput)
- **Surajmal Jat**

### Why Rajputs and Jats Sided with Wazir

**Their Grievance:**
- These guys were **irate with Marathas**
- Why? Traditionally thought THEY should be getting the revenues from fertile land of North India
- That was given to the Marathas instead

**Their Goal:**
- "How can we **get rid of Marathas** from the north?"
- "Drive them to the south"
- That was their big goal

**Their Alliance:**
- Willing to partner with Safdar Jung
- Against the Marathas

---

## The Final Meeting

### Before Leaving Delhi

**What Happened:**
- Before leaving Delhi
- Safdar Jung Wazir had a **one-on-one meeting** with the Emperor
- Told him without any **sweet words or etiquette**
- Just gave it to him **as he felt**

### Safdar Jung's Speech

**What He Said:**

> "My master, I'm in this favor of my master. You can give me permission to go anywhere. I'm ready to go there. Order me wherever you want me to go and I will go there."

> "You can give the position to the person who comes to your mind. You can give the position, the prime minister position to whomever you wish."

**The Message:**
- I'll go wherever you command
- You can replace me if you want
- It's up to you

---

## The Emperor Seizes the Opportunity

### The Removal

**What the Emperor Did:**
- This presented a **readymade opportunity** to replace the wazir
- That is **exactly what he wanted to do**

**The Action:**
- **Freed him** (pad mukta) of his position of wazir
- Gave him **permission to go back to Awadh**
- As the Subedar of Awadh (which he already was)

**The Spin:**
- Not technically "kicked out" (though harsh to say)
- "Removed" him from the wazir key
- Gave him permission to manage his own kingdom in Awadh

**On Paper:**
- "You can go back to Awadh and manage everything in your own kingdom"
- Not a bad offer, actually

---

## Safdar Jung Refuses to Leave

### The Unexpected Response

**What Happened:**
- Even though Safdar Jung said "I'm willing to do blah blah blah"
- He **really didn't like it**
- Was **not hoping** Emperor would take such an extreme step

**His Decision:**
- Didn't want to give up the power
- So he **didn't leave Delhi**
- Just **stayed put in Delhi**

---

## The Surajmal Jat Gambit

### Escalating the Situation

**What Safdar Jung Did:**
- Invited **Surajmal Jat** into Delhi
- Surajmal and his army came into Delhi
- They did **a lot of looting in Delhi**

**The Consequence:**
- The Emperor got **mad**

---

## The Formal Sacking

### The Official Removal

**What Changed:**
- Previously: Emperor said "if you're asking to be relieved, I'm relieving you"
- "You can go back to your kingdom"
- Tried to do it the **nice way**

**But Now:**
- "You're **still in Delhi**"
- "So now I'm **sacking you**"
- "You're **done**"
- **Formally sacked**

---

## The Nuclear Option: Declaring a New Emperor

### Safdar Jung's Desperate Move

**What He Did:**
- Declared someone else should be Emperor
- Said: "He's **royal blood**"
- "Safdar Jung did all this" (justifying the move)

**Who He Declared:**
- "He's the **grandson** [descendant] of **Aurangzeb**"
- "I'm making him the **new Emperor**"

### The Coup Attempt

**What This Means:**
- Trying to do a **full-out coup**
- Not just refusing to leave
- Actually trying to **replace the Emperor**
- Claiming a different heir has legitimacy

---

## The Emperor's Reaction

### The Insult

**What This Was:**
- A **big insult** (upma)
- The Emperor got **mad**
- "This is **too much**"
- A **huge slap in the face**

## The Factional Breakdown

### Why Rajputs and Jats Backed Safdar Jung

**Their Calculation:**
- **Enemy of my enemy is my friend**
- They HATE the Marathas
- Marathas took "their" revenues
- Marathas are with the Emperor
- Therefore: side with Safdar Jung against Emperor

**Their Logic:**
- If Safdar Jung wins → maybe he'll give THEM the revenues
- If Safdar Jung replaces Emperor → new deal possible
- Anything to get rid of Marathas from the north

### Why Marathas Backed the Emperor

**Their Calculation:**
- **They have a treaty with THIS Emperor**
- Bribed by the Emperor (through Mankeshwar)
- If new Emperor → treaty might be void
- Better to stick with the devil they know

## Strategic Analysis

### Safdar Jung's Fatal Mistakes

**Mistake #1: The Bluff**
- Offered to resign
- Thought Emperor wouldn't accept
- **Emperor called his bluff**

**Mistake #2: Staying in Delhi**
- Refused to leave after being removed
- Made his intentions obvious
- Gave Emperor time to organize against him

**Mistake #3: The Surajmal Gambit**
- Brought in forces that **looted Delhi**
- Made him look like the bad guy
- Turned public opinion against him

**Mistake #4: The Coup Attempt**
- Went too far
- Declaring a new Emperor = treason
- Point of no return
- Forced everyone to pick sides

### The Emperor's Smart Moves

**Move #1: Bribing Mankeshwar**
- Secured Maratha support
- They're the real military power
- Made them choose him over wazir

**Move #2: Taking the Resignation Offer**
- Called Safdar Jung's bluff
- Made him look like he was refusing legal orders

**Move #3: Formal Sacking**
- Escalated legally and officially
- Made Safdar Jung's position untenable

### The Conspiracy Web

**Who's Plotting Against Safdar Jung:**
1. Udham Bai (revenge for Javed Khan)
2. Imad ul-Mulk (ungrateful protégé)
3. Kamruddin's sons (revenge for their father's faction)
4. The Emperor (wants control back)

**Who's Supporting Safdar Jung:**
1. Madhav Singh (hates Marathas)
2. Surajmal Jat (hates Marathas)
3. [His own forces from Awadh]

**The Wildcard:**
- Marathas backed the Emperor
- But if new Emperor → who knows?
- They're there for money, not loyalty

---

## The Rajput-Jat Calculation

### Why They Hate Marathas

**The Resentment:**
- These fertile northern lands were "theirs" traditionally
- They had claims to Agra and Ajmer
- Marathas are outsiders from the Deccan
- Getting revenues that should go to local powers

**The Goal:**
- Push Marathas back south
- Reclaim the revenues
- Restore "proper" order (in their view)

### Why They Back Safdar Jung

**The Logic:**
- Safdar Jung is fighting the Emperor
- Emperor is backed by Marathas
- Therefore: help Safdar Jung fight Marathas
- If Safdar Jung wins → he might reward them with territories
- Worth the gamble

---

## The Maratha Dilemma

### Why They Backed the Emperor

**The Practical Reasons:**
1. **The Bribe** - Mankeshwar was paid
2. **The Treaty** - Made with THIS Emperor specifically
3. **The Revenue** - Granted by THIS Emperor
4. **The Risk** - New Emperor might cancel everything

**The Problem:**
- They're mercenaries essentially
- Following the money
- But this puts them at odds with other Hindu powers
- Rajputs and Jats now see them as the enemy

### The Long-Term Consequence

**What This Means:**
- Marathas vs. Rajputs vs. Jats
- Hindu powers divided
- When Abdali comes → disunited
- Each pursuing their own interests
- No united front possible

---

## The Characters Still to Enter

### Bhau

**What We Know:**
- One of the "most important" figures
- Already mentioned
- Coming into focus now
- Will play major role

### Vishwasrao

**What We Know:**
- Peshwa's son
- Will enter "a little later"
- Will play a **decisive role in the very end**
- This is major foreshadowing

### The Unknown Character

**The Tease:**
- "One more character that has to enter"
- Still waiting to be introduced
- Must be important if specifically mentioned

---

## The Impending Disaster

### What We're Building Towards

**The Elements:**
1. **Civil war** in Delhi (Emperor vs. former Wazir)
2. **Maratha involvement** on Emperor's side
3. **Rajput-Jat involvement** on Wazir's side
4. **Abdali waiting** for the right moment
5. **Internal conspiracies** (Imad ul-Mulk, Udham Bai)
6. **New characters coming** (Bhau, Vishwasrao, mystery person)

**The Prediction:**
- "Going to get into some **bloody battle**" (Mankeshwar)
- "Anarchy" in Delhi
- Reaching "new low" for Mughal Empire

---

## Key Themes

1. **The Resignation Gambit Backfires** - Offering to quit when you don't mean it
2. **Refusing to Accept Reality** - Staying in Delhi after being fired
3. **Escalation Through Looting** - Surajmal's forces in Delhi
4. **The Nuclear Option** - Declaring a new Emperor
5. **Bought Loyalty** - Marathas following the bribes
6. **Hindu Disunity** - Marathas vs. Rajputs vs. Jats
7. **The Conspirators Circle** - Everyone plotting against Safdar Jung
8. **The Foreshadowing** - Vishwasrao's "decisive role in the very end"

---

## The Ironies

**Irony #1:**
- Safdar Jung executed Javed Khan for attempted coup
- Now attempting a coup himself
- Becoming what he destroyed

**Irony #2:**
- Raised Imad ul-Mulk as his own son
- Imad ul-Mulk now conspiring against him
- Kindness repaid with betrayal

**Irony #3:**
- Marathas signed treaty to protect Emperor from external threats
- Now protecting him from internal threat (former wazir)
- But this makes other Hindus hate them

**Irony #4:**
- Safdar Jung allied with Marathas to beat Rohillas
- Now Marathas are his enemies
- The alliance that made him strong will destroy him

**Irony #5:**
- Rajputs and Jats side with Safdar Jung (Muslim)
- Against Emperor (Muslim) and Marathas (Hindu)
- Religion matters less than revenue

---

## What Happens Next?

**The Cliffhanger:**
- Safdar Jung has declared a new Emperor
- Current Emperor is enraged
- This is "too much" - the ultimate insult
- **Where we left off**

**The Questions:**
1. Will the coup succeed?
2. Will Marathas stay loyal to current Emperor?
3. Will Rajput-Jat forces be enough?
4. What will Abdali do while Delhi tears itself apart?
5. When do Bhau and Vishwasrao arrive?
6. Who is the mystery character still to enter?
