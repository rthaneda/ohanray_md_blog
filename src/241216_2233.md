# Govind Panth Bundele's Raid & Abdali's Fifth Invasion (October-December 1759)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Govind Panth Bundele: The Administrator-Warrior

### The Origin Story

**How Bundelkhand Came to Marathas:**

*The Rescue Mission:*
- **Bajirao I** went to help Bundelkhand king
- King was old and under attack by Bangush
- Bajirao saved his life

*The Reward:*
> "I will give you one third of my kingdom because you saved my life and I will give you my daughter Mastani in marriage."

**What Bajirao Got:**
- 1/3 of Bundelkhand kingdom
- His daughter **Mastani** (the famous love story)
- Maybe treasure

**Geographic Reality:**
- Bundelkhand = far north from Pune
- Hundreds of kilometers away
- Not very close to Delhi, but "kind of close"
- Bajirao had to appoint officials to manage it

---

## Govind Panth's Role

### The Civilian Administrator

**Who He Was:**
- Originally from Maharashtra
- Appointed by Bajirao I
- Managed day-to-day affairs of Maratha Bundelkhand
- Civilian officer, not primarily military

**His Title:**
> "His real name is not Bundele [as a last name] but he inherited this Bundele because he was based in Bundelkhand."

**How Titles Work:**
- Like "Peshwa" - becomes part of name
- Based in Bundelkhand = called "Bundele"
- Title from territory/role

**His Longevity:**
- Continued working after Bajirao I died
- Managed affairs for decades
- Fairly old now (mid-late 50s)

---

## His Job Description

### Tax Collector

**The Primary Function:**
> "Typically what he will do is he will go from farm to farm and collect the farm revenue from the farmers."

**Why:**
- Taxes were money
- Money was essential
- Had to be collected "on an orderly and accurate basis"
- Civilian officer role

**His Army:**
- Had small force: 1,000-2,000 soldiers
- NOT meant for typical warfare
- Could do defensive/offensive posture if needed
- But primarily for administration/security

---

## The Northern Outflanking Maneuver

### Dattaji's Strategy

**The Map Shows:**
- Outflanking maneuver
- Govind Panth's raid in the north
- Going through **Haridwar** area

**Why North:**
- Ganga comes from the north
- As it comes into flatland, gains width
- Gains "voluminous water"
- But at Haridwar = "still a smaller stream"
- Not too big yet
- Easier to cross

---

## The Recap: Failed Cavalry Charge

### 15 September 1759

**What Happened:**
- Dattaji's army split into two
- Approached from two directions
- Najeeb hid his men in ravines
- Waiting for Maratha charge

**The Ambush:**
> "Immediately the cavalry reached the ravines of Shukratal a deadly fire greeted them and several hundred were killed."

**The Casualties:**
- Jankoji injured
- Barha Sayyids sustained big loss
- Dattaji had to hold back

**The Decision:**
- Send Govind Panth Bundele north
- Cross Ganga there
- Invade Najeeb's territory (Nazibabad)
- On eastern side of Ganga

---

## Nazibabad: Najeeb's Achievement

### The Personal City

**The Name:**
- "Bad" = like "ville" in English (town, city)
- Similar to "Pur" in Hindi
- Just attach to name
- Becomes "town of X"

**Examples:**
- Nazibabad = Najeeb's town
- Ahmadabad = Ahmad's city
- Pattern of naming

**The Pride:**
> "So-and-so really grew up so much that he called it Nazibabad."

- Named after himself
- Shows his power/achievement
- Center of his small kingdom

---

## The Raid Begins (Third Week of October 1759)

### Crossing the Ganga

**The Attack:**
> "Around the third week of October 1759, [Govind Panth] began attacking Najeeb's territory on the east of the Ganga."

**Two-Sided Attack:**
- One from front (Dattaji at Shukratal)
- One from back (Govind Panth from north)

---

## The Rohilla Chiefs' Reluctance

### Internal Rohilla Politics

**Najeeb Appeals for Help:**
> "Najeeb watched in dismay, appealing for help from Hafiz Rehmat Khan and Dunde Khan, the Rohilla chiefs who did not see eye to eye with Najeeb."

**Why They Didn't Like Him:**
- Najeeb "was not the top Rohilla commander"
- He was ambitious
- Very creative
- Very deceptive

**Their Refusal:**
- Didn't want to help him
- Could have helped save Nazibabad
- Said: "We are not going to come to your help"
- Najeeb disappointed

---

## The Family at Risk

### Zabita Khan and Pathargarh

**The Vulnerability:**
> "Najeeb's son Zabita Khan and his family were at his fort, Pathargarh."

**The Eventual Response:**
- Hafiz Rehmat and Dunde Khan finally came
- Confronted Govind Panth "a few miles from Nazibabad"

**The Battle:**
> "But Govind Panth defeated them and headed for the bridge that was Najeeb's supply line from his capital."

---

## Cutting the Supply Line

### The Strategic Strike

**The Impact:**
> "For a while, Govind Panth's raid created a shortage of food in Najeeb's camp."

**Why:**
- Bridge controlled by Govind Panth's force
- No food could come from city (Nazibabad)
- Army at Shukratal being strangled

**The Principle:**
> "Supply line, once it cuts off, then it's tough. His army will be strangled because they won't get fresh supplies through that bridge."

---

## Shuja's Gosavis Arrive

### The Hindu Reinforcements

**The Response:**
> "Meanwhile, the Hindu Gosavi army of Shuja-ud-Daula reached there and faced Govind Panth."

**The Battle:**
- Hindu vs. Hindu
- Gosavis working for Shuja (Muslim)
- Fighting Marathas (Hindu)
- Shows complexity of alliances

---

## Shuja's Position Explained

### Why He Opposed Marathas

**His Natural Inclination:**
- Mother pro-Maratha
- Father (Safdar Jang) worked with Marathas sometimes
- He was Shia (relatively moderate)
- Not extremist like Rohillas

**The Problem:**
- "Dead opposed to Imad"
- Imad = arch enemy
- Marathas allied with Imad
- Therefore must oppose Marathas

**Dattaji's Real Goal:**
> "Dattaji had no interest in getting into Shuja-ud-Daula's territory or raiding him at all. He wanted to go eastward."

**The Target:**
- **Patna** = staging ground
- Then **Bengal** = revenue source

**The Trap:**
> "But because of the politics played by Mr. Najeeb Khan, now he was bogged down and Shuja-ud-Daula was into the fray. So it became difficult."

---

## The River Problem (Again)

### The Persistent Weakness

**The Reality:**
> "And again, Marathas didn't know how to cross the rivers. Technology wise."

---

## Meanwhile in the Deccan (9 November 1759)

### The Two-Front War

**The Southern Campaign:**
> "In the Deccan, the Peshwa and Sadashiv Rao Bhau were planning a decisive move to reduce the Nizam and occupied the prestigious Ahmadnagar fort on 9th of November 1759."

---

## Ahmadnagar: The Historical Significance

### The Original Nizam Shah

**What Is Ahmadnagar:**
- Capital of original **Nizam Shah** kingdom
- NOT the new Nizam (Mughal Subedar)
- Original Nizam from this region

**The History:**
- Shivaji's father worked for him
- Mughal army conquered completely
- Kingdom "totally liquidated"
- Divided between Adil Shah and Mughals
- Major forts still there

**Today:**
- Located in Maharashtra
- Still important historical site

---

## Abdali's Messenger (6 November 1759)

### The Intelligence Mission

**The Arrival:**
> "On 6th of November, 1759, Abdali's messenger came to Delhi with a letter inquiring about the situation there."

**Five Days Later (11 November):**
- Peshwa's agent wrote to Nana Saheb
- Reported on Abdali's message

**What the Agent Said:**
> "Abdali's agent has brought orders for Madho Singh, Vijay Singh, Najeeb Khan, and Yakub Ali Khan."

---

## Who Asked Abdali to Come

### The Coalition

**The List:**
- **Madho Singh** (Jaipur)
- **Vijay Singh** (Jodhpur)
- **Najeeb Khan** (Rohilla)
- **Yakub Ali Khan**

**Why They Called Him:**
- "All were endangered by the Maratha army"
- Especially fratricidal affairs in Rajasthan
- Marathas interfering in succession wars

**Najeeb's Desperation:**
- His life in danger
- "Existential risk for him"
- Not going to live long without help
- "Going to be gone"

**His Only Ally:**
- Had Malhar Rao Holkar
- But Malhar Rao in Pune now
- Can't protect him
- Has to deal with Dattaji
- Dattaji has "no soft corner for him"

**The Savior:**
- Only hope = Abdali in Afghanistan
- Trying "every which way" to lure him
- Otherwise knows "he is going to be gone"

---

## Abdali's Response

### The Advance Force

**Jahan Khan Sent:**
> "He has said he is ready to come to India and has dispatched Jahan Khan ahead with an army to Lahore."

**Who Is Jahan Khan:**
- One of Abdali's commanders
- Sent to Punjab capital (Lahore)
- Advance force

---

## Abdali's Intelligence Requirements

### The Information Request

**What Abdali Asked For:**
> "Abdali has asked to be given a clear picture about the imperial court, the officers, Suraj Mal Jat, Shuja-ud-Daula, and the Srimanta's house."

**Breaking It Down:**

1. **Imperial court** - What's happening with Emperor
2. **The officers** - All the power players
3. **Suraj Mal Jat** - Status and position
4. **Shuja-ud-Daula** - His situation
5. **Srimanta's house** - The rich people

**Why So Detailed:**
> "See, Abdali was strategic. Before coming to India, he wanted to get idea about what is happening."

**The Calculation:**
- "All the local players he wants to know about"
- "Doesn't want to get surprises"
- Must have allies
- "Doesn't want to fight a losing battle on his own"

---

## The Resource Question

### Why Abdali Needs Intelligence

**The Army's Needs:**
- His army = massive
- "Going to need resources"
- Animals have to be fed
- People have to eat
- Must pay salaries

**The Solution:**
> "So he has to loot and make money."

**The Strategic Approach:**
- Must know terrain
- Must know allies
- Must know enemies
- Must know resource locations
- Very strategic in "rounding up allies"

**The Enemy:**
> "And he knows that his only enemy is Marathas."

---

## The Tribute Question

### Extracting Money from Allies

**Abdali's Request:**
> "He has also asked Najeeb Khan about the tributes from Hindustan."

**The Money Details:**
- Wants to know who will give how much
- Even allies must pay

**The Parties:**
- Madho Singh
- Vijay Singh
- Suraj Mal Jat
- Mughal Emperor
- Even the Rohillas

**The Service:**
> "So driving up the Marathas is not a free service."

**Abdali's Focus:**
> "Oh no, he's all about money. He wants to loot."

---

## The Information Asymmetry

### Why Details Matter

**The Negotiation Advantage:**
- If someone can pay $5 million
- Why ask for only $1 million?
- Need to know their capacity
- Maximize extraction

**Getting the Intel:**
> "So that information he needs from Najeeb Khan. All the details."

---

## The Letter Reaches Pune (Early December 1759)

### Terrible Timing

**When It Arrived:**
> "This letter from Delhi would have reached the Peshwa in early December 1759 when the Maratha army was heading out to face the Nizam."

**The Situation:**
- Peshwa in December 1759
- Heading SOUTH
- Large force committed to fighting Nizam

**The Overstretch:**
> "No, Marathas are stretched thin. Fighting two big battles or in two different geographies."

---

## Abdali's Fifth Invasion Begins

### The March to India

**The Decision:**
> "Meanwhile, Ahmad Shah Abdali, heeding appeals by Najeeb and other Indian kings, finally began his march into India for his fifth invasion, while Dattaji was still trying to enforce a siege at Shukratal."

**Najeeb's Desperation:**
- Cannot survive unless he distracts Maratha army
- Right at his doorstep (Shukratal)
- Needs "anything and everything" to convince Abdali

---

## Abdali's Internal Situation

### Why Now

**The Afghan Security:**
- Was fighting tribal wars in Afghanistan
- "Now he has concluded them"
- Knows he's secure in Afghanistan

**The Calculation:**
> "When he goes to India, he's going to spend at least four to six months."

**The Risk:**
- In his absence, other tribes could attack
- "Then he'll be in trouble in Afghanistan itself"
- Doesn't want that

**The Solution:**
- "Wants to make sure that he's secure in Afghanistan"
- Now satisfied he is

**December 1759:**
- Decides: "I'm going to India now"
- Beginning his march
- Fifth invasion
- Perfect timing for allies

---

## Chapter 15: Najeeb Bakes a Plot

### The Ominous Title

**The Quote:**
- From **Govind Panth Bundele**
- **November 1759**

> "A great disaster has befallen us."

---

## Najeeb: The Schemer

### Ahead of His Time

**The Assessment:**
> "So Najeeb Khan is a schemer. He's ahead of his time. He's doing all this rumors and propaganda spreading. He's clever."

**The Strategy:**
> "Because see what he lacks in battlefield, he's trying to make it up."

**The Method:**
- Through schemes
- Propaganda
- Rumors
- Political manipulation
- Coalition building

**The New Plot:**
- Now "baking a new plot"
- Something even more devious coming
- Cliffhanger for next session

---

---

## Major Themes

### 1. The Administrator Goes to War
Govind Panth = tax collector with small army, now executing critical military operation.

### 2. The Professional Invader
Abdali gathering intelligence, securing home front, calculating tribute. Methodical.

### 3. Reluctant Allies
Rohilla chiefs don't like Najeeb, but finally help. Coalition building works.

### 4. The Two-Front Trap
North vs. Najeeb/coalition, South vs. Nizam. Classic overextension disaster.

### 5. The Service Fee
Even "allies" must pay Abdali. Nothing is free. Professional looter.

### 6. Hindu vs. Hindu (Again)
Gosavi forces (Hindu) vs. Marathas (Hindu). Identity doesn't determine loyalty.

### 7. The Schemer's Advantage
Najeeb lacks battlefield strength, compensates with propaganda and plots.

---

## The Strategic Picture (December 1759)

**Maratha Position:**
- Dattaji stuck at Shukratal siege
- Govind Panth cut supply line (temporarily successful)
- But Shuja's Gosavis arrived
- Two-front war: North (Najeeb) and South (Nizam)
- Forces stretched impossibly thin
- No real allies

**Enemy Coalition:**
- Najeeb entrenched at Shukratal
- All Rohillas unified (reluctantly)
- Shuja-ud-Daula committed forces
- All northern princes want Marathas gone
- Everyone calling for Abdali

**Abdali's Preparations:**
- Secured Afghanistan
- Gathered intelligence on all players
- Calculated tribute requirements
- Sent advance force (Jahan Khan to Lahore)
- Beginning march (5th invasion)
- Perfect timing

**The Quote:**
> "A great disaster has befallen us."

**The New Threat:**
- Najeeb "baking a plot"
- Some new scheme brewing
- What he lacks in battle = makes up in manipulation

---

## The Mastani Connection

### Full Circle

**The Origin:**
- Bajirao I saved Bundelkhand king
- Received 1/3 kingdom + Mastani
- Famous love story
- Appointed Govind Panth to manage territory

**Now (1759):**
- That same territory's administrator
- Fighting to save Maratha position
- Territory secured 40+ years ago
- Now critical in northern war

**The Irony:**
- Romantic story → administrative appointment → military crisis
- Long-term consequence of short-term decisions
- Everything connected across decades

---

## The Professional vs. The Amateur

### Abdali's Approach

**What He Does:**
1. Secure home front first
2. Gather comprehensive intelligence
3. Identify all players and their positions
4. Calculate resource requirements
5. Ensure allies committed
6. Send advance force
7. Begin methodical march
8. Know exactly what tribute to extract

**Why He Wins:**
- Professional invader
- Done this multiple times
- Learns from each campaign
- Doesn't take unnecessary risks
- Maximizes profit, minimizes cost

### Maratha Approach

**What They Do:**
1. Overextend across vast territories
2. Ignore warnings about enemies
3. Trust people who shouldn't be trusted
4. Fight on multiple fronts
5. Leave critical positions undermanned
6. Depend on technologies they don't have
7. Make enemies of potential allies

**Why They're Vulnerable:**
- Expansion over consolidation
- Optimism over realism
- Assumption over intelligence
- Stretched resources over focused strength

---

*Govind Panth Bundele - a 50+ year old tax collector with 1,000-2,000 soldiers - just executed a brilliant flanking maneuver, crossed the Ganga up north, defeated Rohilla chiefs, and cut Najeeb's supply line. This is the GOOD news. The bad news: Shuja's Hindu Gosavis arrived. Abdali is marching from Afghanistan with his massive professional army, having gathered perfect intelligence, secured his home front, calculated his tribute extraction, and timed his arrival perfectly. The Peshwa just committed a large force to fight the Nizam in the south. Dattaji is stuck at an unbreakable siege. And Najeeb - the schemer who makes up in manipulation what he lacks on the battlefield - is "baking a plot." "A great disaster has befallen us" is right.*
