# The Siege at Shukratal & Najeeb's Coalition (September-November 1759)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Najeeb Rallies the Rohillas

### Building Unity Among Afghans

**The Recruitment:**
> "Even as Najeeb was promising Dattaji all possible help, he began recruiting the other Rohilas to his cause and went about fortifying his own position."

**Who Were the Rohillas:**
- Afghan warriors/soldiers
- Came to India originally as mercenaries
- Became immigrants and stayed
- Had their own territories in Rohilkhand

**Why They Stayed:**
- Saw fertile land with rivers
- Much better than Afghanistan
- Settled permanently
- But never forgot Afghan loyalty

---

## The Call to Abdali (Repeated)

### The Desperate Appeals

**Who Wrote to Abdali:**
> "The North Indian princes sent letters to Abdali calling him to India."

**The Coalition:**
- **Madho Singh** (Jaipur)
- **Vijay Singh** (Jodhpur) 
- Other Rajasthani princes
- All harassed by Marathas
- All wanting them gone

### Why Northern Princes Hated Marathas

**The Initial Welcome:**
- First invited Marathas for help
- Needed assistance in succession wars
- Temporary alliance

**The Souring:**
> "Later on they started realizing that it is more trouble than it is worth."

**The Problem:**
- Marathas were "overwhelming force"
- Creating their own power structures
- Oppressive behavior
- Filling Mughal power vacuum
- But nobody actually liked them

---

## The Shivaji Vision Failed in the North

### Why Hindu Unity Didn't Work

**Shivaji's Legacy:**
- Created concept: Muslims are foreign outsiders
- Need Hindu government/kingdom
- Unite under Hindu banner

**Before Shivaji:**
- Maratha warriors fought for different Muslim kings
- Killing each other
- No unity

**The Northern Situation:**
- Didn't understand Shivaji's vision
- Rajasthanis (Hindu) didn't unite with Marathas
- Suraj Mal Jat (Hindu) same problem
- Hostility between different forces continued

**The Perception:**
> "Marathas just wanted to get money. They were mercenary. That mercenary spirit did not create this single Hindu identity."

**The Result:**
> "They were also looked upon as mercenaries who didn't have anybody's interest in mind. Sowing chaos without any regard."

---

## The Emperor's Desperation

### Writing to Everyone

**The Pattern:**
- Emperor writing to Peshwa
- Emperor also writing to Najeeb
- "He's really" feeling terrorized

**The Irony:**
- Supposed to be ruler
- Actually powerless
- Playing both sides
- Desperate for protection

---

## North India: A Friendless Place

### Complete Isolation

**The Summary:**
> "North India had become a friendless place for the Marathas. Everyone hated them, either openly or secretly."

**The Rajput Kings:**
- Madho Singh (Jaipur)
- Vijay Singh (Jodhpur)
- "Keen to see the end of Maratha attacks"
- Writing to Abdali to defeat them

---

## The Move to Shukratal

### Waiting for the Bridge

**Dattaji's Position:**
- Went to **Garmukhteshwar**
- Expected bridge would be completed
- Najeeb never intended to build it

**When Monsoon Came:**
> "Once the rains began, Najeeb pleaded that the work could not proceed."

**The Timeline:**
- July-August 1759 (monsoon months)
- Najeeb's excuse: "It's raining, I can't build the bridge"

**The Reality:**
> "The river was a torrent many miles wide and the area around it full of swamps and slush."

**The Consequence:**
> "This meant further delay for the Maratha thrust into Awadh and Bengal."

---

## Moving to Miranpur

### Getting Closer to Najeeb

**Dattaji's Frustration:**
> "Dattaji, annoyed and alarmed at the delay, now moved his camp to Miranpur close to Shukratal where Najeeb Khan had already entrenched himself."

**The Setup:**
- Dattaji: Camp at Miranpur
- Najeeb: Entrenched at Shukratal
- "Najeeb was ready for him now"

---

## Shukratal: The Natural Fortress

### Geographic Advantages

**Location:**
- Just south of **Haridwar** (holy city)
- East of **Muzaffarnagar**
- On Ganga's right bank
- Ancient Hindu pilgrimage place

**The Terrain:**
> "This sunken area lies with the Ganga behind it and is an area with plenty of ravines that offer places for an army to hide."

**Najeeb's Strategy:**
> "It was a natural sunken fort and Najeeb used this topography to convert this place into a strong defensive fort against the numerically superior Marathas."

### Perfect Defensive Position

**Undulating Terrain:**
> "Shukratal's undulating terrain could hide Najeeb's army of several thousand foot soldiers armed with muskets and cannons."

**The Comparison:**
- "So now he was going to play **Garimikawa**"
- "Just like Shivaji"
- Guerrilla warfare
- But against the Marathas!

**The Irony:**
- Shivaji used terrain against larger enemies
- Now Najeeb using same tactics
- Against Shivaji's descendants

---

## The Cavalry Problem

### Marathas' Advantage Neutralized

**The Soft Ground:**
> "Its soft terrain in the monsoons was not conducive to cavalry charges that the Marathas used."

**Why This Mattered:**
- "Marathas were primarily cavalry men"
- Horses are very heavy
- Soft monsoon ground = can't charge effectively
- Main Maratha tactic neutralized

---

## Najeeb's Defensive Setup

### Water Protection

**The Rivers:**
- Small tributary of Ganga at Shukratal
- Wide Ganga a few kilometers away on eastern side
- Huge central swampy area (now farmland)

**The Trenches:**
> "Najeeb dug deep trenches on the remaining two fronts and launched a strong defense."

### The Supply Line

**Provisions:**
> "The army was assured of provisions from Najeeb's possessions on the east of the river."

**The Bridge:**
> "Najeeb had erected a bridge of boats here that Dattaji once wanted to use, but which now helped Najeeb's communications."

**The Irony:**
- Dattaji wanted this bridge
- Now it's helping his enemy
- Najeeb using it for supplies

---

## The Barha Sayyids Join Dattaji

### Shia vs. Sunni

**Who Were Barha Sayyids:**
- Shia Muslims
- Opposed to Najeeb (Sunni)
- Joined Dattaji's side

**The Religious Divide:**
- Sometimes trumped Muslim unity
- Shia-Sunni tension real
- Worked in Marathas' favor here

---

## The Siege Begins

### Stalemate

**Dattaji's Approach:**
> "Dattaji set his camp at Miranpur and tried to enforce a siege at Shukratal to force Najeeb to yield."

**The Problem:**
> "The Maratha cavalry could not attack Najeeb's position and the skirmishes between the two armies yielded nothing."

**The Waiting Game:**
- Neither side could make progress
- Siege going on for months
- Stalemate situation

---

## The Gamble on Abdali

### Najeeb's Desperate Appeals

**The Calculation:**
- If Abdali doesn't come = steamrolled
- But Abdali wasn't close
- Might not arrive in time

**The Repeated Entreaties:**
> "Najeeb was sending emissaries every month to Kandahar beseeching Abdali to come to his aid."

**Why Other Rohillas Agreed:**
- Initially reluctant
- Finally said: "Okay, you got it"
- Sent troops to help Najeeb

---

## Imad-ul-Mulk Refuses to Help

### The Maratha Ally Won't Comply

**Dattaji's Order:**
> "Dattaji ordered Imad to join him with his troops but Imad did not comply."

**Why This Mattered:**
- Imad supposed to be Maratha ally
- Not showing up with troops
- Dattaji fighting alone
- Another sign of isolation

---

## Shuja-ud-Daula's Decision

### The Tipping Point

**The Factors:**
- Threat to his own kingdom (Awadh)
- Maratha alliance with his "arch enemy" Imad
- Finally forced his hand

**The Decision:**
> "The threat to his own kingdom and the Maratha alliance with his arch enemy Imad finally helped him make up his mind in favor of Najeeb Khan."

**The Logic:**
- Not per se against Marathas
- But "dead opposed to Imad"
- Since Marathas allied with Imad
- Must oppose Marathas

**The Sides:**
> "Basically the sides were drawn. They had to oppose Marathas because they were on the side of Imad-ul-Mulk."

---

## Shuja Sends Hindu Troops

### The Gosavi Chiefs

**Who He Sent:**
> "Shuja sent his Gosavi chiefs Anup Gir and Umrao Gir to protect Najeeb's position."

**Who Were Gosavis:**
- **Hindu warriors**
- Clan of fighters
- Worked for Awadh's kingdom

**The Irony:**
- Hindu soldiers
- Fighting for Muslim Subedar
- Against Hindu Marathas
- Shows complexity of alliances

**Shuja's Army:**
- Had both Muslim and Hindu soldiers
- Didn't matter to him
- Just paid salaries
- They fought for him

---

## The Failed Cavalry Charge (15 September 1759)

### Dattaji's Impatience

**The Setup:**
> "Impatient due to the enforced inactivity, Dattaji led his cavalry to Shukratal on 15th September 1759."

**The Approach:**
- Army split into two
- Approached from two directions
- Standard cavalry tactic

### The Ambush

**Najeeb's Trap:**
> "Najeeb hid his men in wait for the Maratha charge."

**What Happened:**
> "Immediately the cavalry reached the ravines of Shukratal a deadly fire greeted them and several hundred were killed."

**The Casualties:**
- Several hundred Marathas killed
- **Jankoji was injured**
- Barha Sayyids sustained big loss

**The Retreat:**
- Dattaji had to hold back
- Cavalry charge failed
- Couldn't break Najeeb's position

---

## The Northern Flanking Maneuver

### Govind Panth Bundele

**Who Was He:**
- Administrator of Maratha-controlled Bundelkhand
- Civilian officer managing revenues
- Collecting taxes from farms
- Had small army (1,000-2,000 soldiers)
- Not meant for typical warfare
- But could do defensive/offensive if needed

**His Background:**
- Originally from Maharashtra
- Appointed by **Bajirao I** to manage Bundelkhand
- Bundelkhand = territory given to Bajirao by grateful king
- After Bajirao's death, continued managing affairs
- Fairly old (mid-late 50s)

**Why "Bundele":**
- Real name not Bundele
- Got title from being based in Bundelkhand
- Like "Peshwa" - becomes part of name

---

## The Strategy

### Why Send Bundele North

**Dattaji's Plan:**
> "Dattaji decided to send an army under Govind Panth Bundele further north across the Ganga to invade Najeeb's own territory around Nazibabad."

**The Logic:**

*Reason 1 - Geography:*
- North of Shukratal = Haridwar area
- Ganga still smaller stream there
- Easier to cross
- Not yet widened into massive river

*Reason 2 - Defenses:*
- Nazibabad not so well defended
- Najeeb put all forces into Shukratal
- Capital vulnerable

*Reason 3 - Squeeze Play:*
- Attack from behind
- Force Najeeb to return to defend home
- Maybe take over Nazibabad
- Cut off his base

**The Outflanking:**
- Going around the strong position
- Hitting from unexpected direction
- Classic military maneuver

---

## Govind Panth's Raid (Late October 1759)

### Crossing the Ganga

**Around Third Week of October 1759:**
- Govind Panth crossed Ganga in the north
- Began attacking Najeeb's territory
- East of Ganga (Najeeb's homeland)

**Najeeb's Reaction:**
> "Najeeb watched in dismay."

---

## The Rohilla Response

### Appealing to Rival Chiefs

**The Call for Help:**
> "Appealing for help from Hafiz Rehmat Khan and Dunde Khan, the Rohilla chiefs who did not see eye to eye with Najeeb."

**The Problem:**
- These two Rohilla chiefs didn't like Najeeb
- Najeeb "was not the top Rohilla commander"
- He was ambitious, creative, deceptive
- But they didn't want to help him

**The Disappointment:**
- Could have helped save Nazibabad
- Said: "We are not going to come to your help"
- Najeeb disappointed

---

## The Family Situation

### Najeeb's Vulnerability

**Where His Family Was:**
> "Najeeb's son Zabita Khan and his family were at his fort, Pathargarh."

**The Eventual Response:**
> "Hafiz Rehmat and Dunde Khan finally came to confront Govind Panth a few miles from Nazibabad..."

**The Outcome:**
> "...but Govind Panth defeated them and headed for the bridge that was Najeeb's supply line from his capital."

---

## Cutting the Supply Line

### The Strategic Target

**What Govind Panth Did:**
- Defeated the Rohilla chiefs
- Headed for Najeeb's bridge
- This bridge = supply line from Nazibabad
- Critical logistics link

**The Effect:**
> "For a while, Govind Panth's raid created a shortage of food in Najeeb's camp."

**Why:**
- Bridge controlled by Govind Panth's force
- No food could come from the city
- Army at Shukratal being strangled
- "Supply line, once it cuts off, then it's tough"

---

## Shuja's Gosavis Arrive

### The Hindu vs. Hindu Battle

**The Reinforcement:**
> "Meanwhile, the Hindu Gosavi army of Shuja-ud-Daula reached there and faced Govind Panth."

**The Situation:**
- Hindu Maratha force (Govind Panth)
- vs. Hindu Gosavi force (serving Shuja)
- Fighting each other
- While Muslims watch

**The Complexity:**
- Religion not determining alliances
- Political interests trump religious identity
- Shows failure of Hindu unity concept

---

## Shuja-ud-Daula's Position

### Why He Opposed Marathas

**Shuja's Natural Inclination:**
- Mother was pro-Maratha
- Father (Safdar Jang) worked with Marathas
- He was Shia (relatively moderate)
- "Normally would not be going" against Marathas
- Not an extremist

**But:**
- Suja was "dead opposed to Imad"
- Imad = his arch enemy
- Marathas allied with Imad
- Therefore must oppose Marathas

**The Geography:**
> "Dattaji had no interest in getting into Shuja-ud-Daula's territory or raiding him at all. He wanted to go eastward."

**Dattaji's Real Goal:**
- Just wanted to pass through
- Get to Patna (Bihar)
- Then to Bengal
- Not interested in Awadh

**The Trap:**
> "But because of the politics played by Mr. Najeeb Khan, now he was bogged down and Shuja-ud-Daula was into the fray. So it became difficult."

---

## Meanwhile in the Deccan

### Peshwa's Other Campaign

**9 November 1759:**
> "In the Deccan, the Peshwa and Sadashiv Rao Bhau were planning a decisive move to reduce the Nizam and occupied the prestigious Ahmadnagar fort."

**What's Ahmadnagar:**
- Historical significance
- Original Nizam Shah's capital
- Where Shivaji's father worked
- Major fort in Maharashtra today
- Mughal army had conquered it centuries ago
- Sliced up kingdom between Adil Shah and Mughals

**The Point:**
- Marathas fighting on TWO fronts
- North: Dattaji vs. Najeeb/coalition
- South: Peshwa vs. Nizam
- Forces stretched impossibly thin

---

## Abdali's Messenger Arrives (6 November 1759)

### The Inquiry

**The Letter:**
> "On 6th of November, 1759, Abdali's messenger came to Delhi with a letter inquiring about the situation there."

**Five Days Later (11 November):**
- Peshwa's agent wrote to Nana Saheb
- Reporting on Abdali's messenger

**What the Agent Reported:**
> "Abdali's agent has brought orders for Madho Singh, Vijay Singh, Najeeb Khan, and Yakub Ali Khan."

**Who Are These:**
- All the guys who asked Abdali to come
- All endangered by Maratha army
- Madho Singh & Vijay Singh = Rajasthan
- Najeeb = life in danger
- They need Abdali or they're "going to be gone"

---

## Abdali's Preparations

### The Strategic Planning

**Jahan Khan Sent Ahead:**
> "He has said he is ready to come to India and has dispatched Jahan Khan ahead with an army to Lahore."

**Jahan Khan:**
- One of Abdali's commanders
- Sent to Lahore (Punjab capital)
- Advance force

**Abdali's Intelligence Gathering:**
> "Abdali has asked to be given a clear picture about the imperial court, the officers, Suraj Mal Jat, Shuja-ud-Daula, and the Srimanta's house."

**What He Wants to Know:**
- Imperial court situation
- All the officers
- Suraj Mal Jat's status
- Shuja-ud-Daula's situation
- Rich people ("Srimanta")

**Why:**
> "He doesn't want to get surprises. He knows that unless he gets allies, he doesn't want to fight a losing battle on his own."

**The Resource Question:**
- His army massive
- Needs resources
- Animals need feeding
- People need eating
- Must pay salaries
- Has to loot and make money

---

## The Tribute Question

### Even Allies Must Pay

**Abdali's Inquiry:**
> "He has also asked Najeeb Khan about the tributes from Hindustan."

**The Money Issue:**
- Wants to know who will give how much
- Even allies must pay tribute

**The Service Fee:**
> "Driving up the Marathas is not a free service."

**Abdali's Priorities:**
- "He's all about money. He wants to loot."
- Wants to know each party's capacity
- Information from Najeeb critical
- Don't ask for $1M if they can pay $5M

---

## The Letter Reaches Pune (Early December 1759)

### Peshwa's Timing Problem

**When News Arrived:**
> "This letter from Delhi would have reached the Peshwa in early December 1759 when the Maratha army was heading out to face the Nizam."

**The Situation:**
- December 1759
- Marathas heading SOUTH
- To fight Nizam
- Large force committed

**The Overextension:**
> "Marathas are stretched thin. Fighting two big battles in two different geographies."

---

## Abdali's Fifth Invasion Begins

### The Final Piece Falls

**The Decision:**
> "Meanwhile, Ahmad Shah Abdali, heeding appeals by Najeeb and other Indian kings, finally began his march into India for his fifth invasion, while Dattaji was still trying to enforce a siege at Shukratal."

**Why Now:**
- Najeeb desperate
- Cannot survive without distraction
- Needs anything to pull Maratha attention
- Abdali relatively secure in Afghanistan

**The Afghan Internal Situation:**
- Was fighting tribal wars
- Now concluded them
- Secure when he leaves
- Can spend 4-6 months in India
- No threats at home

**December 1759:**
- Abdali decides to come to India
- Beginning his march
- Fifth invasion
- Perfect timing for his allies

---

## The Ominous Chapter Title

### Chapter 15 Preview

**Title:** "Najeeb-ud-Daula Bakes a Plot"

**The Quote:**
- From Govind Panth Bundele
- November 1759

> "A great disaster has befallen us."

**The Cliffhanger:**
- Najeeb creating new scheme
- "He's ahead of his time"
- Doing rumors and propaganda
- What he lacks on battlefield
- Makes up with scheming

---

---

## Major Themes

### 1. The Natural Fortress
Shukratal's terrain = perfect defensive position. Najeeb using Shivaji's tactics against Marathas.

### 2. Hindu vs. Hindu
Gosavi warriors (Hindu) fighting for Muslim Shuja against Hindu Marathas. Identity complex.

### 3. The Failed Unity
Northern Hindus didn't unite under Maratha banner. Seen as mercenaries, not liberators.

### 4. The Two-Front War
Fighting Najeeb in north, Nizam in south. Stretched impossibly thin.

### 5. The Soft Ground
Monsoon terrain neutralizing Maratha cavalry advantage. Their strength = their weakness.

### 6. The Coalition Effect
One by one, everyone joining against Marathas. Complete isolation.

### 7. Abdali's Calculation
Gathering intelligence, ensuring allies, planning resource extraction. Professional invader.

---

## The Trap Closes

**The Situation by December 1759:**
- Dattaji stuck in siege at Shukratal
- Failed cavalry charge
- Jankoji injured
- Govind Panth cut off supply line (temporary success)
- But Shuja's Gosavis arrived
- Imad won't send troops
- Everyone calling Abdali
- Abdali marching to India
- Peshwa fighting Nizam in south
- Forces stretched between two fronts
- No real allies
- "Great disaster has befallen us"
- Najeeb "baking a plot"

---

*The noose has tightened into a chokehold. Dattaji is stuck at an unbreakable fortress. His cavalry - the Maratha's greatest weapon - neutralized by soggy ground. Hindu fights Hindu while Muslims coordinate. Every northern prince wants Abdali to come save them. And Abdali, the professional looter, is gathering his intelligence, securing his allies, calculating his tribute payments, and marching toward India with his massive army. Meanwhile, the Peshwa in Pune just committed a large force to fight the Nizam in the south. Two-front war. No friends. Abdali coming. "A great disaster has befallen us" indeed.*
