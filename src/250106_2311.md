# Bhau's Boat Bridge Plan & The Unfair Blame (April-June 1760)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Boat Bridge Strategy

**The Order to Govindapant:**
> "Find out how you can build a bridge out of boats."

**Why:**
- Bhau's army traveling to Doab
- Must cross Yamuna river
- To meet Suja-ud-Daula
- Fight Abdali in the Doab

**The Timing Problem:**
- Left Patadur **March 14, 1760**
- Takes 2-3 months to reach Yamuna
- By then: **Monsoon starts** (June-July)
- River will be full
- Must prepare bridge in advance

---

## Why the Whole Army Had to Move

**The Threat:**
> "Abdali was waiting in the north. He was actually in Doab himself. So that would just be an opportunity for him to strike."

**The Lesson:**
- Learned from Taji Shinde's fate
- Learned from Holkar's defeats
- Can't risk small contingent
- Must be properly protected

---

## Abdali's Timing Advantage

**The Critical Detail:**
> "Before Sadashiv Rao Bhau was chosen as leader, Abdali was already in Anupshahar."

**Anupshahar:**
- In the Doab itself
- **In Suja's territory**
- Abdali camped there before Bhau even selected

**The Sequence:**
1. Abdali arrives → camps in Suja's land
2. Taji dies → news reaches Pune
3. Meeting at Udgir → Bhau chosen
4. Result: **Abdali has huge head start**

---

## The Unfair Blame on Bhau

**Why He Gets Blamed:**
> "Sadashiv Rao Bhau is blamed for the fall of Panipat battle."
- 100,000+ killed
- Prestige lost
- Enormous damage

**Why It's Unfair:**
> "That was not entirely his fault. Over the years, Shinde and Holkar armies had created that environment."

**What They Created:**
- Harassed Rajputs constantly
- Harassed Suraj Mal Jat
- Only wanted tributes, money
- Made natural allies into enemies

**Bhau's Innocence:**
- Had nothing to do with it
- **First time crossing Narmada**
- First time in north
- Inheriting the whole mess
- Politics of north already poisoned

---

## Bajirao I: The Strategic Genius

**Why Shahu Chose Him:**
> "Shinde and Holkar were good fighters. But they had no brains."

**Their Mistakes:**
- Only looked at tactical advantages
- Harassed Rajasthan princes for money
- Made them mad
- Lost natural allies

**Bajirao I's Difference:**
- Not just fighter - had **brains**
- Great warrior AND great statesman
- Strategic thinker

**His Principle:**
> "You cannot make enemies out of our natural allies."

---

## The Tree Analogy

**Shahu's Test:**
- "Who is biggest enemy of Marathas?"
- "How would you deal with Mughals?"

**Bajirao's Answer:**
> "You can go after branches of big tree. But if you cut the trunk, entire tree comes down. You don't have to go after each and every branch."

**The Strategy:**
- Trunk = Mughal Empire
- Branches = Small kingdoms they spawned
- Go after the trunk, not branches
- Strategic over tactical thinking

**Why This Mattered:**
- Shahu chose **19-year-old** Bajirao
- Over experienced commanders
- Because he had strategic vision
- "That turned out to be correct decision"

---

## Bhau's Reconciliation Attempts

**Messengers Sent (Late April 1760):**
- To **Madhav Singh of Jaipur**
- To **Vijay Singh of Jodhpur**

**What He Asked:**
1. Send troops
2. Send funds
3. Send supplies

**His Pitch:**
> "We are all Indians. We live in India. Abdali is outright foreigner and has no business here. We should all be on same side."

**The Vision:**
- Unite all Indian powers
- Fight foreign army together
- Even tried to include Rohilas
- But difficult to convince after years of harassment

---

## Why Govindapant Failed

**The Assignment:**
- Build bridge out of boats
- Meet Suja-ud-Daula
- Convince him to join

**Why It Failed:**
> "Could not accomplish the task given to him."

**The Problems:**
1. **Couldn't reach Suja** to convince
2. **Couldn't build bridge** across Yamuna

**Why:**
- Abdali's forces lurking around Itawa
- 10,000-20,000 Afghan soldiers moving
- Govindapant only had 4,000-5,000 soldiers
- Didn't want to start skirmish (would lose)
- Bridge takes weeks to build
- Too vulnerable during construction

## Key Figures

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| **Sadashiv Rao Bhau** | Gets unfair blame, inherited mess |
| **Bajirao I** | Strategic genius, chose trunk over branches |
| **Shahu** | King with foresight, chose Bajirao at 19 |
| **Shinde/Holkar** | "No brains," harassed natural allies |
| **Govindapant Bundele** | Failed mission (not his fault) |

## Major Themes

### 1. The Inherited Mess
Bhau inherits years of bad diplomacy. Rajputs angry, Suraj Mal angry, natural allies driven away.

### 2. Strategic vs Tactical
Bajirao I understood strategy (trunk). Shinde/Holkar only understood tactics (grab money now).

### 3. Politics > Military
> "Politics is biggest part of battle. Physical battle is just fighting in different way to resolve differences."

### 4. Timing is Everything
Abdali in Anupshahar before Bhau even chosen. Head start is massive.

### 5. The Bridge Problem
Can't build bridge with enemy around. Maratha weakness at river crossings apparent.

---

## Geographic Context

- **Anupshahar:** In Doab, Suja's territory, where Abdali camped
- **Itawa:** Only Maratha-held city in Doab, surrounded by Afghan forces
- **Yamuna:** Major river crossing needed

---

**Where we left off:** Bhau trying to undo years of damage. Sent messengers to Rajputs. Ordered bridge built. But Govindapant can't accomplish either - Afghan forces everywhere. Abdali already in position. Bhau still hundreds of miles away. The political damage may be irreversible.

---

*"If only Bajirao had no brains" successors. Now Bhau, capable but inexperienced in north, inherits their mess. Trying to fix it, but Abdali's timing advantage and river-crossing weakness may prove fatal.*
