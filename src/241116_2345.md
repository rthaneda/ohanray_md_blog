# Marathas Reach Attock: The Pinnacle That Wasn't (1757-1758)
## Raghunath Rao's Northern Campaign, Iran's Offer, & The Empire on Borrowed Money

---

## The Afghan Retreat

### Why Taimur Shah Fled

**The Situation:**
- **Taimur Shah** (Abdali's son) and **Jahan Khan** (commander-in-chief) in Lahore
- Abdali **couldn't send reinforcements**
- Too busy with internal Afghan revolts
- Afghanistan itself in turmoil

**The Strategy:**
- Left Lahore
- Crossed the **Ravi River** toward Afghanistan
- Got closer to safety

**Why This Mattered:**
- If Marathas pursued, they'd have to **cross the Ravi**
- River crossings = time-consuming
- Quick defensive position

---

## Punjab: Land of Five Rivers

### Understanding the Geography

**What "Punjab" Means:**
- **"Punj"** = Five
- **"Ab"** = Rivers/Waters
- **Punjab** = Land of Five Rivers

**The Rivers:**
- All start in the **Himalayas**
- Empty into the **Sindhu (Indus) River**
- Provide **fresh sweet water**
- Make Punjab **extremely fertile**

**Why This Matters:**
- Fertile = high agricultural output
- High output = enormous tax revenue
- **Punjab was a prize worth fighting for**

---

## April 19, 1758: Lahore Falls

### The Maratha Victory

**What Happened:**
- **Manaji Paigude** (important Maratha commander) entered Lahore
- **10,000 Maratha forces**
- **1,000 Mughal soldiers** with them
- **11,000 total**

**Afghan Response:**
- **Left all their stuff behind**
- **Just fled**
- Wanted to escape quickly
- Everything fell into Maratha hands

### The New Power Structure

**Adina Beg:**
- Probably the new **Subedar of Punjab**
- Working with the Sikhs

**The Sikhs:**
- Rising power in Punjab
- Multiple groups (**misls**)
- Each misl = 100-200 fighters (like tribes)
- Developing their own power structure
- **NOT fully in control yet, but gaining strength**

---

## The Sikh Backstory

### Why Sikhs Were Rising

**History:**
- Previous Punjab Subedar (the one who fell off horse and died)
- His father was **Kamruddin Khan** (Mughal Wazir)
- That Subedar was **dead set against Sikhs**
- **Massacred Sikhs** in a big way (~10 years ago)

**Now:**
- Sikh community **gaining serious strength**
- Fighting both Mughals AND Abdali's forces
- Still not in full control of Punjab
- But getting stronger

**Important:** They were gathering steam, not yet dominant.

---

## The Ultimate Achievement: Attock

### The Border Town

**Attock:**
- Town **across the Sindhu River**
- **Border between Mughal Empire and Afghanistan**
- During Aurangzeb's time, Mughals controlled beyond it
- Now, because of Abdali, **Attock was the boundary**

**What Marathas Did:**
- **Reached all the way to Attock**
- Pushed Afghan forces **beyond Attock into Afghanistan**
- Took the **fort at Attock**

**Why This Was HUGE:**
- **Marathas had never gone that far north**
- Mughal forces hadn't been that far north in ages
- Located on banks of Sindhu River
- A **hallmark achievement**

**Today:** Attock is in Pakistan (northwest Punjab)

---

## Beyond Attock: Peshawar

### Even Further North

**Who Went:**
- **Tukoji Holkar** (Holkar clan, maybe younger brother of Malhar Rao)
- **Sabaji Shinde** (Shinde clan)

**Where They Went:**
- All the way to **Peshawar**
- Even **further north and west** from Attock
- Getting close to **Kabul** (Abdali's capital)

**The Achievement:**
- **No Maratha force had EVER gone this far**
- **Great feat of achievement**
- Credited to Raghunath Rao's campaign
- Pretty amazing

---

## The Fatal Flaw

### What They Didn't Do

**The Problem:**
- Didn't establish **permanent administration**
- Didn't set up **governance structures**
- Didn't leave **permanent forces** to defend the areas
- **Very weak administration**

**The Result:**
- Once Raghunath Rao came back (he wasn't staying)
- Started **losing the areas** they'd conquered
- Couldn't hold Attock and Peshawar
- All that ground would be lost

**Why:**
- **Abdali wasn't going to sit still**
- Currently busy putting down rebellions in Afghanistan
- But **as soon as he pacified those tribes, he'd be back**

---

## The Celebration in Lahore

### Raghunath Rao's Coronation Ceremony

**Shalimar Bagh, Lahore:**
- Raghunath Rao built a **memorial**
- To commemorate Marathas reaching Attock/Lahore
- Honored in a grand public function

**The Ceremony:**
- **Elevated throne**
- Raghunath Rao welcomed
- People came to **pay respects**
- **Rose water** sprinkled through fountains
- **Lights burning** everywhere in the city

**The Meaning:**
> "This was the **pinnacle of Maratha success**. This kind of thing had not been achieved in the past."

---

## Iran's Shocking Proposal

### The Shah's Offer

**What Iran Proposed:**
- Iran's king showed **willingness to help Marathas**
- Goal: **Crush Abdali in combined fashion**
- Proposed boundary: **Attock should be the border between Iran and India**

**The Strategy:**
> "Both of us can squeeze Abdali **out of existence**"

- Get rid of Afghanistan as a country
- Shah didn't believe in Afghanistan as separate country anyway
- Just **split the difference and divide it up**

---

## Why Afghanistan Didn't Exist Before

### The Tribal Reality

**History:**
- **No such country as Afghanistan** before Abdali
- Mughals were strong on one side
- Iranian king was strong on the other
- Afghan **tribes in between** never held territory
- **Tribes fought each other constantly**

**The Nature of Afghans:**
- No interest in permanent government
- If no outside pressure, **they fight each other**
- Never got along
- **Very freedom-loving people** (even today)
- Protect their freedom, way of life, belief systems

**Why No One Conquers Afghanistan:**
- **Nothing there worth fighting over**
- Huge mountains
- No sweet water
- No oil, no minerals
- No food, no grains
- No animals
- Just barren, mountainous terrain

---

## Raghunath Rao's Refusal

### The Arrogant Response

**What Raghunath Rao Did:**
- **Didn't show interest** in eliminating Afghanistan
- Didn't want to divide it with Iran

**What He Wrote to Nana Saheb:**
- Communicated via letters to Pune
- **"Kabul and Kandahar are part of India"**
- No reason to negotiate with Shah of Iran
- **"It's not Iran's either. It's all ours."**

**The Message:** No negotiation needed. It's ours to take.

---

## Nana Saheb: The Uncrowned Emperor

### India's Real Power (1757-1758)

**The Achievement:**
- In his **18 years of rule**, taken most of India under his rule
- Well, "rule" is a **loose term**

**What "Rule" Actually Meant:**
- Marathas **never really ruled** areas beyond the Khan
- No permanent forces, garrisons, or stations
- Didn't have that kind of structure or force
- Would require **huge force** they didn't have

**But:**
- **No other force could give them a run for the money**
- **Undisputed champs by default**
- By default lords of India

---

## The Southern Front: Battle of Sindkhed

### Nizam Still a Problem (1757)

**What Happened:**
- End of 1757
- Peshwa defeated **Nizam** at **Battle of Sindkhed**
- Sindkhed is in the Deccan area (south)
- Nizam based in Hyderabad
- **Big success** for Nana Saheb

**Why This Matters:**
> "While Marathas were doing all these politics and battles in the north, they still had a **permanent enemy** in terms of Nizam."

**The Reality:**
- Always had to **keep a force ready around Pune**
- Nizam was **right next door**
- Never knew when situation might develop
- Could get ugly at any moment

---

## Pune: The Unannounced Capital

### The New Power Center

**1757-1758 Reality:**
- **Pune had become the unannounced capital of India**
- Peshwa so famous his **name was known all over India**

**What Everyone Believed:**
- Marathas were able to **keep control of Punjab**
- So far away from their native land (at least 1,000 miles)
- No small feat to maintain control
- That's what **everybody believed**

**The Problem:**
> "They were not really there yet because they didn't have that kind of human resource, but everybody else believed that they were capable of doing that."

**Translation:** Everyone THOUGHT Marathas could hold Punjab. **Abdali would prove them wrong.**

---

## Abdali: Squeezed and Scrambling

### Why He Was Vulnerable

**The Pressure:**
1. **Iran** bothering him on western flank
2. **Internal revolts** - tribes attacking, revolting
3. Different Afghan tribes in different areas
4. No central rule in Afghan history
5. Abdali trying to **create central authority**

**The Task:**
- Deal with internal disturbances constantly
- Afghanistan = big empire (Iran) on one side
- Mughal Empire on the other side
- **Squeezed between two powers**
- **No resources** - that's why he raided India all the time

**The Risk:**
> "It was difficult to know whether he would come out of this in an unscathed manner. He could have been overwhelmed and failed."

---

## The Missed Opportunity

### Why Raghunath Rao Should've Accepted

**If He'd Accepted Iran's Offer:**
- Could have **squeezed Abdali** between Iran and Marathas
- Potentially eliminated him
- Ended the Afghan threat

**Why He Didn't:**
- Marathas believed **Kandahar and Kabul were part of India**
- Historically true:
  - Iran had claimed **Kandahar**
  - Mughals controlled **Kabul**
  - Only when Abdali became powerful did he take both

**Raghunath Rao's Thinking:**
> "He didn't even think Abdali would come back to Punjab because he thought Abdali would be **mired in internal strife** and Iranian threat."

**The Miscalculation:**
- Abdali had tried to control Punjab **three times before**
- It went back and forth (installing Subedars, getting driven out)
- Raghunath Rao thought: "He's too busy, won't come back"

**This was the wrong guess.**

---

## The Nephew's Defection

### A Potential Asset

**Who:**
- **Abdur Rahman**
- Abdali's nephew (brother's son)

**What He Did:**
- Came to **Pune**
- Came to the **Peshwa**
- Wanted Peshwa's help

**Why:**
- To support his own claim?
- Turning against Abdali?
- [Details unclear, will be explained more later]

**What Peshwa Did:**
- Sent him to **Raghunath Rao**

**The Implications:**
- Having Abdali's nephew as an ally
- Undermines Abdali if Peshwa backs the nephew
- Could be useful leverage

## Geographic Context

**The Rivers of Punjab:**
- Five rivers from Himalayas → Sindhu
- Make Punjab extremely fertile
- Sweet water abundance

**Key Locations (North to South):**
1. **Kabul** - Abdali's capital (Afghanistan)
2. **Peshawar** - Furthest Marathas reached
3. **Attock** - Border town on Sindhu River
4. **Lahore** - Capital of Punjab
5. **Ravi River** - Afghans crossed for safety
6. **Punjab** - The prize province
7. **Delhi** - Mughal capital
8. **Pune** - Real power center

---

## Key Themes

### 1. **The Glory Without Foundation**
- Marathas achieved something **never done before**
- But **didn't build infrastructure to hold it**
- Symbolic victory, not sustainable victory

### 2. **The Missed Alliance**
- Iran + Marathas could have **eliminated Abdali**
- Raghunath Rao's arrogance prevented it
- "It's all ours" attitude

### 3. **Financial vs Military Success**
- Military achievement was spectacular
- But as we'll see, **financial situation was disaster**
- Nana Saheb cared about the bottom line

### 4. **Perception vs Reality**
- Everyone THOUGHT Marathas could hold Punjab
- Reality: they didn't have the resources
- **Abdali would prove them wrong**

### 5. **The Sikh Variable**
- Rising power in Punjab
- Not yet dominant, but getting stronger
- Would become major factor in the region

### 6. **Abdali's Vulnerability**
- Squeezed between Iran and Mughals/Marathas
- Internal revolts consuming his attention
- But **temporary vulnerability**

### 7. **No Real Governance**
- Marathas never truly "ruled" their conquests
- Just collected tribute
- **No permanent presence = no permanent control**

---

## Critical Insights

### The Afghanistan Question

**Why It Never Existed:**
- Tribes too busy fighting each other
- No resources worth controlling
- No one could unite them before Abdali

**Abdali's Achievement:**
- Actually creating **central authority**
- Uniting the tribes (slowly)
- Making Afghanistan a real power

**The Mistake:**
- Thinking he'd stay busy with internal problems
- Underestimating his ability to bounce back
- Not taking the opportunity to eliminate him

---

### The Punjab Problem

**Why It Was So Hard to Hold:**
1. **Distance** - 1,000+ miles from Maratha heartland
2. **Climate** - Different weather patterns (will be important)
3. **Rivers** - Five major rivers to cross
4. **Sikhs** - Rising power, could fight Marathas
5. **Afghans** - Would keep trying to retake it
6. **Cost** - Maintaining large army = financially impossible

---

### The Real Achievement

**What Raghunath Rao Actually Did:**
- Took advantage of Abdali being distracted
- Pushed further north than any Maratha before
- Created perception of invincibility
- Built Maratha prestige

**What He Didn't Do:**
- Create lasting governance
- Build permanent defenses
- Make sustainable arrangements
- Bring back enough money (more on this next)

---

## Foreshadowing

### What This Sets Up

**The Inevitable:**
1. Abdali **will** pacify Afghan revolts
2. He **will** return to Punjab
3. Maratha control **will** collapse
4. Because they didn't build proper infrastructure
5. Financial problems are coming (as we'll see)
6. The nephew's defection will complicate things

**The Question:**
- Was this great campaign worth it?
- Or just an expensive ego trip?
- Nana Saheb will have thoughts about this...

**The Ominous:**
> "Abdali would prove everyone wrong."

---

**April 1758: Raghunath Rao reaches the highest point any Maratha ever reached - Attock, and even Peshawar beyond it. Rose water fountains and city lights celebrate him in Lahore. The Shah of Iran offers to squeeze Afghanistan out of existence together. Raghunath Rao refuses arrogantly: "Kabul and Kandahar are ours, not yours." Pune is now the unannounced capital of India. Everyone believes the Marathas can hold Punjab permanently, 1,000 miles from home. They're wrong. No permanent administration, no permanent forces, no sustainable structure. Just a spectacular raid that touched the northwestern corner and pulled back. Abdali is temporarily busy with revolts and Iran. But it's temporary. He'll deal with his problems. Then he'll be back. And that weak infrastructure? That arrogant refusal of Iranian help? That overconfidence? It's all going to matter. The pinnacle of success was actually the beginning of the fall.**
