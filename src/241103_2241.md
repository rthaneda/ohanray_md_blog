- Securing the loot immediately - send it home first
- Abdali himself staying at **Shalimar Bagh** area in Delhi

- Small forces, observing
- "Maybe in due time we will meet him in the battleground"

---

---

## Why Mathura Matters

### The Religious Significance

**Location:** Mathura (south of Delhi)

**Why It's Holy:**
- **Krishna's birthplace**
- One of the most religiously significant sites in Northern India
- Born in jail (Kaus's prison)

### The Story

**The Prophecy:**
- First six children would be daughters
- Seventh would be a son
- **He would kill his uncle (Kaus)**

**Kaus's Response:**
- Put Krishna's mother in prison
- Killed every child at birth
- Didn't wait for the seventh
- Wanted no chances

**The Escape:**
- Father took the newborn Krishna at night
- Put him in a basket
- Smuggled him out of prison
- Yamuna River was swollen (monsoon)
- Started walking through the dangerous currents

**The Miracle:**
- When baby's feet touched the water
- **Water started receding** around the father
- Gave him a path across the river
- Crossed without effort

**The Result:**
- Landed in **Gokul** (other side of Yamuna)
- Krishna grew up there, safe from his uncle

**Religious Importance:**
- Mathura = birthplace
- Pilgrimage site for Hindus
- Thousands visit for religious rites
- Non-combatant civilians

---

## The Systematic Destruction Orders

### Abdali's Commands

**The Scope:**
> "From **Akbarabad (Agra)** to **Mathura**, everything has to be **leveled**. भूइ सपाट (Flat to the ground). If there is any structure, it has to be brought down to ground level."

**Translation:**
- Don't allow anything to stand
- Complete destruction
- Raze everything
- Make an example

---

## The Ideological Justification

### Abdali's Message to Farrukhabad

**To Ahmad Khan Bangash (who was scared):**

> "I have come to **re-establish Islam** in Delhi and India. How will **Darbhadri** (third-rate) Marathas survive ahead of me?"

**Darbhadri** = Third-rate, inferior

**His Declaration:**
- "I will totally destroy them"
- "They won't even remain as some existence in this country"
- **"My firm decision: Throw them out to the south"**
- "They should be in Deccan, south of the Narmada"
- "They don't belong here - this is Mughal/Muslim area"

---

## The March to Mathura

### Jahan Khan's Big Army

**The Movement:**
- Jahan Khan had a large army
- Marched toward Mathura

**The Massacre Before Arrival:**
- Before **Antaji Mankeshwar** could reach Mathura
- **About 1,000 Marathas were massacred**
- Quick, brutal attack

### The Atrocities Continue

**On the Way:**
- Afghans started coming south
- **Leveled Faridabad** - burned it completely
- **Bestowed hundreds of heads to Abdali**
- Incentive system: **8 rupees per head**

**Why This Encouraged Killing:**
- Financial reward for each murder
- More heads = more money
- Made massacre profitable
- Systematic incentive for genocide

---

## Jawahar Singh's Heroic Stand

### The Defender

**Who He Was:**
- **Surajmal Jat's son**
- Met the Afghan army on their march

**Why He Decided to Fight:**

1. **Mathura had no weapons** - just a religious pilgrimage site
2. **Jahan Khan's army wanted unlimited massacre**
3. **Lots of non-combatants** - came for religious rites
4. **No defense** - only temples, no army, no fortifications
5. **Unarmed civilians** would be slaughtered

**His Forces:**
- Only **5,000 soldiers**
- Against Jahan Khan's much larger army

---

## The Battle for Mathura

### The Brave Fight

**What Happened:**
- Jawahar Singh fought bravely
- Gave a tough fight
- Tried to protect the pilgrims

**The Casualties:**
- **3,000 of his 5,000 soldiers** were killed
- 60% casualties
- Heroic last stand

### The Retreat

**The Decision:**
- Realized it was a lost cause
- Couldn't protect the city with remaining forces (only 2,000 left)
- Had to save what remained of his army
- **Retreated to Vallabhgarh fort**
- Fled for safety

**The Result:**
- Mathura was now **totally unprotected**
- Jahan Khan had free run
- The massacre could begin

---

## The Siege of Vallabhgarh

### The Fort

**Type of Fort:**
- Not a mountainous fort (like Raigad or Pratapgad)
- **Not totally Bhui Kot** (ground-level fort)
- On a hill with steep walls
- Offers some protection
- But not as difficult to scale as mountain forts

### Abdali's Decision

**The Strategy:**
- Decided to **lay siege** to Vallabhgarh
- Would attack the fort
- Run over it if necessary
- Couldn't let the resistance escape

## The Incentive System for Genocide

### 8 Rupees Per Head

**How It Worked:**
1. Kill someone
2. Behead them
3. Bring the head back
4. Get paid **8 rupees**

**Why This Is Evil:**
- Turns murder into profit
- Creates competition to kill more
- Makes genocide systematic
- Financially rewards atrocities
- Encourages soldiers to maximize killing

**The Result:**
- Hundreds of heads sent to Abdali
- Like a business transaction
- Proof of payment = severed heads
- Commodification of human life

---

## The Religious/Ideological Framing

### Abdali's Justification

**His Stated Mission:**
> "Re-establish Islam in Delhi and India"

**His View of Marathas:**
- **"Darbhadri"** - Third-rate, inferior
- Don't belong north of Narmada
- Should be kicked out to the Deccan
- This is Muslim territory

**His Goal:**
- Complete destruction of Maratha presence in North
- Religious war (Jihad)
- Cleanse the "pollution" of kafirs
- Make them not even exist in the region

---

## Why Mathura Was Targeted

### Strategic + Symbolic Destruction

**Strategic Reasons:**
1. **Base for resistance** - Surajmal Jat was there
2. **Maratha presence** - Small forces stationed
3. **Show of force** - Make an example

**Symbolic Reasons:**
1. **Most holy site for Hindus** - Krishna's birthplace
2. **Non-combatant pilgrims** - Easy targets
3. **Religious significance** - Destroy their faith centers
4. **Send a message** - "This is what we do to kafirs"

**The Strategy:**
> Attack the holiest place. Make the most brutal example. Show what happens to those who resist. Break their spirit by destroying what they hold most sacred.

---

## The Geography

**The Region:**
- **Delhi** (north) - Already looted and controlled
- **Faridabad** (between Delhi and Mathura) - Burned completely
- **Mathura** (religious center) - Target for massacre
- **Agra/Akbarabad** (south of Mathura) - To be leveled
- **Vallabhgarh** (Jat fort) - Under siege

**The Yamuna River:**
- Flows through the region
- Mathura on western bank
- Gokul on eastern bank
- Strategic waterway

---

## The Maratha Problem

### Why They Couldn't Stop It

**From Antaji's Letter (January 30):**
- Operating from **Faridabad/Mathura** area
- Small forces
- Not safe to stay close to Delhi
- Waiting for Peshwa to come from Pune
- Asking for help repeatedly

**The Reality:**
- Small Maratha regiment (~2,000?)
- Faced massive Afghan army
- Won one skirmish (Jan 21) but can't hold
- Need reinforcements from Pune
- **Pune is 1,000+ km away**
- By the time help arrives...

---

## Jawahar Singh's Heroism

### The Impossible Choice

**What He Faced:**
- 5,000 soldiers vs. massive Afghan army
- Defending unarmed pilgrims
- Religious site with no defenses
- Knew he'd likely lose

**What He Did:**
- Fought anyway
- Lost 60% of his forces (3,000 killed)
- Saved the remaining 2,000
- Retreated to fight another day

**The Character:**
- Brave
- Strategic (knew when to retreat)
- Honorable (tried to protect civilians)
- Realistic (saved what he could)

---

## Key Themes

1. **Rage as Military Strategy** - Abdali's anger drives systematic destruction
2. **Symbolic Targets** - Attack the holiest sites to break spirits
3. **Profit from Murder** - 8 rupees per head turns genocide into business
4. **Heroic Last Stand** - Jawahar Singh's impossible defense
5. **Religious Justification** - Framing looting as "re-establishing Islam"
6. **The Example** - "Level everything from Agra to Mathura"
7. **Unarmed Victims** - Pilgrims, civilians, non-combatants targeted
8. **Too Little, Too Late** - Marathas can't respond fast enough

---

## The Build-Up

### What's Coming

**Current Status:**
- Mathura unprotected
- Jahan Khan's army has free run
- Vallabhgarh under siege
- Jawahar Singh trapped
- Antaji Mankeshwar trying to reach them
- Systematic destruction ordered

**The Questions:**
1. What will happen in Mathura?
2. Can Vallabhgarh hold?
3. Will Jawahar Singh survive?
4. How bad will the massacre be?
5. When will the main Maratha army arrive?
6. How will Pune respond to this?

---

## The Distance Problem

### Why Help Can't Come Fast Enough

**The Math:**
- **Pune to Mathura:** ~1,400 km
- **Travel time:** Weeks, possibly months with an army
- **Communication time:** Also weeks
- **Mobilization time:** More weeks

**By the Time Pune Responds:**
- Mathura will be destroyed
- Thousands will be dead
- Abdali may have already left
- The damage will be done

**The Tragedy:**
- Marathas have the power to stop this
- But they're too far away
- Small local forces aren't enough
- The massacre will happen before help arrives

---

## Historical Context

### Why This Matters

**The Escalation:**
- Started with looting Delhi
- Now: Systematic religious destruction
- Targeting the holiest Hindu sites
- Mass civilian casualties
- Making examples through brutality

**The Response It Will Trigger:**
- When news reaches Pune...
- This will demand retaliation
- Can't ignore destruction of Mathura
- Sets up the eventual showdown
- **Path to Panipat**

---

**Late January 1757: Abdali's face turns red with rage at defeat. He orders total destruction from Agra to Mathura. "Level everything. Burn it all." Jahan Khan marches with a massive army. 8 rupees per head. Faridabad burns. 1,000 Marathas massacred. Jawahar Singh makes his stand with 5,000 men. Loses 3,000 defending unarmed pilgrims. Retreats to Vallabhgarh. Mathura lies unprotected. The massacre is about to begin. And the Marathas in Pune don't even know yet...**
