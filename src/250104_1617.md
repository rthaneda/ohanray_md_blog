## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

## Opening: Modern Politics Interlude

### The Indian-American Congressional Coalition

**The Photo:**
- Six Indian-American congresspeople
- **Shree** at the center of the photo
- Posted by an Indian congressman

**The Statement:**
> "When I first joined, I was the only Indian congressman and now there are six, so I look forward to welcoming more Indian Americans."

**The Twitter Backlash:**
- Already upset about H-1B visa issues
- "Why are they explicitly saying the goal is more Indian American congressmen?"
- "Why not just good for America policies?"
- People are sensitive right now

### The Original Congressman: Ami Bera

**Who He Is:**
- **Ami Bera, MD**
- Representing **California's 6th District**
- **Sacramento County**
- The original Indian-American congressman
- Before him, there were none

**The Tweet Response:**
- People don't like the fact there's an Indian-American coalition in Congress
- Comparison made: "But there's a Black coalition, so why can't there be an Indian coalition?"

---

## Weather Context: Delhi Fog

**The Conditions:**
- Delhi becomes **extremely foggy**
- Very cold for local people (though not by our standards)
- **No central heating** in India
- Houses have targeted heating only
- Moment you get away from the heater → feels cold

### Why This Mattered Historically

**The Marathas:**
- Especially from Southern India (like Maharashtra)
- Wore very **light clothing**
- **Not used to the cold**
- Northern winter was a huge challenge

**The Struggle:**
- Clothing inadequate for northern winters
- Not adapted to cold climate
- This would be a factor in their campaigns

---

## The Army Departs: March 14, 1760

### Final Preparations

**The Armory:**
- Fort at **Ahmadnagar** supplied necessary ammunition
- For muskets, cannons, rockets, etc.

**The Timing:**
- Soldiers had **no respite** after Udgir campaign
- Little time to compensate losses in arms or horses (steed)
- Had to leave for the north **immediately**

### The Reserve Strategy

**What Was Left Behind:**
> "The army provided to Bhau was the best that could be provided at short notice after keeping enough reserves in the Dakkan to protect the territories from a fresh invasion by the Nizam."

**Why Reserves Mattered:**
- Nizam was **already raiding** scattered Maratha outposts
- **Before the ink was dry** on the Udgir treaty
- He was immediately going back on the treaty
- Despite being defeated at Udgir

**The Solution:**
- **Visaji Krishna** sent to Karnataka
- To ensure no disturbance from that sphere
- Keep southern territories secure

---

## Bhau's First Time in Hindustan

### The Learning Curve

**The Reality:**
> "This was the first time Bhau would cross the Narmada and enter Hindustan, and his knowledge of its people, its potentates, and its politics was to be a learning process for him."

**What This Meant:**
- Never crossed the **Narmada River** before
- Never been to northern part of India
- Didn't know the people
- Didn't know the rulers (potentates)
- Didn't understand the politics
- Would have to learn **on the job**

---

## The Departure

### Leaving Patadur: March 14, 1760

**The Timing:**
- Left at the **start of a hot summer**
- On a turbulent campaign
- To a distant land

**The Mission:**
> "The conflict drew them into a face-to-face confrontation against a deadly foe in a region where the Marathas had very few friends."

**The Reality:**
- Had created **a lot of enemies**
- Many people **sitting on the fence**
- Very few reliable allies
- Heading into hostile territory

---

## Chapter 17: Prakaran 17 - Mitran Chiyashodhat (The Hunt for Allies)

### The Strategic Understanding

**Why Allies Were Critical:**
- Marathas knew they needed allies
- Can't successfully fight this battle alone
- Must secure support before confrontation

**Who They Would Target:**
1. **Suraj Mal** (the Jat)
2. **The Rajasthanis**
3. **Suja-ud-Daula** (Subedar of Awadh)

---

## Suja-ud-Daula: The Fence-Sitter

### Why He Was a Potential Ally

**His Religious Position:**
- **Not a Sunni Muslim**
- Therefore not allied with Abdali
- Not allied with **Najib Khan** (Abdali's patron in India)
- Not completely in sync with them

**The Opportunity:**
- Sitting on the fence
- Could be convinced to join Marathas
- His interests didn't align with Abdali
- Potential for alliance

---

## The Letter: Bappuji Ballar (June 27, 1760)

### Who Was Bappuji Ballar?

**Probably:**
- Stationed in Delhi on behalf of Marathas
- Sending intelligence reports
- Tracking enemy movements

### The Intelligence Report

**What He Reported:**
- **Najib Khan** and **Jahan Khan** have gone to visit Suja-ud-Daula
- Marathas' letters have also been sent to Suja
- Planning to send capable men to meet with him

**The Timing Issue:**
> "Yamuna River has water, maybe because of monsoon or whatever."

- Letter written in **June**
- During the **monsoon season**
- River full of water - harder to cross

---

## Afghanistan & Abdali's Recruiting Strategy

### How Abdali Built His Army

**The Promise:**
- Told his countrymen in Afghanistan:
- "If you accompany me in the invasion of India..."
- "You will get **women and slaves**"

**Why This Worked:**
- That's how he could recruit soldiers
- They had to be promised something
- Loot and plunder were the incentives

### The Afghan Army's Nature

**Primary Objective:**
> "The Afghan army under Abdali, under the command of Abdali, their primary objective was to wage war."

**Why:**
- Only way they could make funds
- Only way to get resources
- **Nothing in their own country**
- Battle was their business

**The Result:**
- **Battle-hardened** army
- Only skill they had
- Only way they could make money

### Internal Tribal Warfare

**Even Among Themselves:**
- Tribes constantly warring with each other
- Fighting for resources
- Used to battling all the time
- External battles were just an extension

**The Advantage:**
- Always in combat mode
- Always ready for war
- Experienced fighters

---

## Abdali's Background & Experience

### The Nadir Shah Connection (1739)

**Abdali's First Visit to India:**
- Came in **1739** with **Nadir Shah**

- Sitting pretty
- Not traveling
- Waiting

---

## The Climate Problem

### Afghans vs. Indian Summer

**The Afghan Weakness:**
> "The Afghan army was used to the cold winters, but not to the summer heat."

**The Opposite Problem:**
- Marathas struggled with northern cold
- Afghans struggled with Indian heat
- Each army had climate disadvantages

---

## Abdali's Advantages

### Knowledge & Experience

**What He Knew:**
- Done so many campaigns in India
- Knew the **weaknesses of Indian armies**
- Knew the **weaknesses of Indian royals**
- Had dealt with them multiple times

**The Pattern:**
> "What to expect and how they will speak tall but not deliver in terms of their actions."

- Indian rulers would make big promises
- But wouldn't follow through
- Abdali knew this from experience

### Geographic Knowledge

**What He Understood:**
- Rivers, mountains, valleys
- All the geographical details
- Not a total foreigner

**His Network:**
- Had people to help him like **Najib Khan**
- Mughal emperor would sometimes talk to both sides
- Aware of happenings in northern plains
- "Proximity awareness"

---

## The Critical Skill: River Crossings

### The Decisive Difference

**Abdali's Advantage:**
> "He knew the art and had the skill of crossing rivers. That was very critical."

**The Maratha Disadvantage:**
> "And the Marathas didn't have it really. They didn't have the skill nor did they understand how to do it."

**The Impact:**
- This was a **major difference**
- Made a **huge difference** in the outcome
- There will be **one particular incident** that was extremely key
- Coming up later in the story

**Remember This Point:** This river-crossing skill gap will be crucial

---

## The Rohillas: Natural Allies

### Bareli & Rohilkhand

**What Is Rohilkhand:**
- Region settled by **Afghan soldiers of fortune**
- Came to India and settled there
- **Bareli** is a town there (exists even today)

**Who Are the Rohillas:**

**Rohilkhand Region:**
- **Bareli** - Rohilla stronghold
- Settled by Afghan soldiers of fortune
- Natural Abdali allies

**Strategic Rivers:**
- **Narmada** - Traditional boundary between north and south India
- **Yamuna** - Full in June (monsoon), hard to cross

**Awadh:**
- Ruled by Suja-ud-Daula
- Key territory
- Both sides courting him

**The Doab:**
- Between Ganga and Yamuna
- Very fertile flat land
- Where Abdali camped

---

## Major Themes

### 1. The Learning Curve
Bhau crossing Narmada for the first time - doesn't know the people, politics, or rulers of the north. Learning on the job.

### 2. Climate as Weapon
Marathas weak in cold, Afghans weak in heat. Each side has environmental disadvantages.

### 3. River Crossings = Game Changer
Abdali's mastery of river crossings vs. Marathas' lack of this skill. Will prove decisive.

### 4. The Alliance Race
Both sides hunting for allies. Winner of alliance race may win the war.

### 5. Experience vs. Inexperience
Abdali's 6th invasion, knows India well. Bhau's first time in the north, knows nothing.

### 6. Upstart Leadership
Najib Khan - no royal blood, but shrewd timing and political skill made him a key player.

### 7. The Afghan Business Model
War is their only way to make money. Promise of loot and slaves = recruitment strategy.

---

## Critical Disadvantages

### For the Marathas:
1. **No cold weather experience** - light clothing, not adapted
2. **No river-crossing skills** - will prove fatal
3. **Bhau's inexperience** - never been to north before
4. **Few friends** - many enemies or fence-sitters
5. **Just fought Udgir** - exhausted, no rest

### For the Afghans:
1. **Summer heat** - not adapted to Indian summers
2. **Foreign force** - need local allies badly
3. **Supply lines** - far from home base

---

## The Coming Storm

**What's Set Up:**
- Both armies hunting for allies
- Suja-ud-Daula being courted by both sides
- Najib Khan working hard for Abdali
- River crossings will matter
- Climate will matter
- Alliances will matter

**The Question:**
- Who will secure more allies?
- Who will adapt better to climate?
- Who will control the river crossings?

---

## The Ironic Contrast

**Marathas:**
- Most magnificent army ever assembled
- But inexperienced in the north
- Don't know the terrain
- Don't know how to cross rivers
- First time for their commander

**Abdali:**
- Battle-hardened force
- 6th invasion - knows India intimately
- Knows all the tricks
- Knows river crossings
- But also a foreigner needing local help

---

**Where we are:** March 1760. The armies are moving. The alliance race has begun. Bhau is learning on the job. Abdali is waiting. The monsoon is coming. And somewhere in all of this, a river crossing will decide everything.

---

*The hunt for allies begins - both sides sending messengers, making promises, trying to secure support. Suja-ud-Daula sits on the fence. Najib Khan works his political magic. And Bhau, crossing the Narmada for the first time in his life, has to navigate a world he doesn't know. The clock is ticking.*
