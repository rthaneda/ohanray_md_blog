# Abdali's Final Diplomatic Push & Bhau's River Struggles (June 1760)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Nature of the Conflict: Afghan vs Indian

**The Setup:**
> "Because Dunde Khan, Hafiz Rehmat Khan and Najib Khan allied openly with Abdali, nature of conflict became: Afghans versus powers within Hindustan."

**Why It Hinged on Suja:**
- If Suja stays on Maratha side → **Afghans vs Hindustani power**
- If Suja goes on Afghan side → **Muslims vs Hindus**

**Why This Mattered:**
> "It's not advisable or desirable for Marathas to have that kind of conflict, Muslim versus Hindu. Because it then polarizes all Muslims to fight against them."

**Suja's Situation:**
- In two minds, confused
- Would rather go on Maratha side
- Had reservations about Abdali
- **But Abdali at his doorstep** - had to be careful

---

## Bhau's Logical Argument

**The Pitch:**
> "We are the protectors of Mughal Empire and Mughal seat of power in Delhi. Abdali is not."

**Why:**
- Abdali is outsider
- Lives far away
- Will come once every 2-4 years
- **Not there being 24/7** like Marathas can be
- Not long-term ally
- Won't protect you

**The Offer:**
- You want to be wazir?
- Mughal Empire has to be protected
- We're here to protect it
- Join our side

**The Minimum:**
> "If you cannot be openly on my side or Maratha side, then at minimum, stay neutral."

---

## The Last Ditch Effort: Sadrunisa Begum

**Bhau's Final Move:**
> "To make last ditch effort, he sent Govindapant to meet with Sadrunisa (Suja's mother)."

**Why:**
- Bhau knew she has **influence on policymaking** in Suja's kingdom
- She was shrewd woman
- Wife of Safdar Jung

**Her Position:**
- Already **leaned towards Maratha side**
- Preferred Suja go with Marathas rather than Abdali

**The Limitation:**
> "She could convince Suja, but royal and sovereign was Suja. Whole power structure was male dominated. She had some influence but didn't have complete power."

**The Result:**
> "Even after doing all that, there was no promise or acknowledgement. He didn't come up with anything that could be relied upon."

- No aswasan (assurance)
- Nothing that could be trusted
- Troublesome situation

---

## Abdali's Counter-Move: The Childhood Friend

**The Genius Strategy:**
> "Abdali was able to find a childhood friend of Safdar Jung or of Sadrunisa Begum."

**Who She Was:**
- **Not an ordinary woman**
- Royal queen of **Muhammad Shah** (now dead)
- He was killed by Imad-ul-Mulk
- Now widow
- Was the **first lady** at the time
- Political personality, shrewd woman
- Well versed in diplomacy and policymaking

**Why This Worked:**
- Childhood friends with Sadrunisa
- Sent by Abdali to turn her

**The Grudge:**
- Her entourage (200 women) had been **looted by Maratha army**
- "So she must not have good opinion of Marathas"

**What She Did:**
- Met with both Sadrunisa (Suja's mother) AND Suja
- **Insisted they go to Abdali side**

---

## The Tilting Scale: Suja's Confusion

**The Marathi Proverb:**
> "You don't know which way you want to lean. You are confused."

**Suja's State:**
- Sometimes leaning this way
- Sometimes leaning that way
- Wasn't sure what was right decision

---

## The Diplomatic Escalation: Jahan Khan's Turn

**After the Lady's Diplomacy:**
> "Now it was turn of Jahan Khan."

**Who Was Jahan Khan:**
- Abdali's commander
- Now trying to convince Suja

**What He Accomplished:**
> "Jahan Khan had taken control of every major post other than Itawa."

**The Situation:**
- Marathas kept control of **Itawa** only
- Everything else: Jahan Khan controlled

---

## The Ultimate Move: Najib Khan Sent

**Why Send Najib:**
> "He rolled dice of sending Najib Khan to Suja, because even Jahan Khan could not do the job. Suja needed further convincing."

**What Abdali Told Najib:**
> "Suja-ud-Daula's influence and capability are great. He is as good as Wazir of Hindustan."

**The Stakes:**
- He has good military power
- If he joins Marathas → **drastically negative impact** on us

**Why Najib Specifically:**
- Not just any diplomat or professional lawyer
- **Personal confidant of Abdali**
- Everyone knew: **Najib Khan is as good as Abdali**

**Their Relationship:**
> "Abdali and Najib Khan's relationship was solid. Not only that, they were like one. Najib Khan totally trusted and looked at Abdali as his savior."

**Why Abdali Didn't Go Himself:**
- Considered himself **on par with emperor**
- Suja was small-time personality
- If Abdali goes → **lowering his value**
- "Not some small fish who he's stooping down to beg favor"
- Must send important emissary instead
- Najib is not ordinary emissary - **one-time deal**
- Important personality, everybody knows works for Abdali

---

## The Bad Blood: Safdar Jung vs Abdali

**The History:**
> "In few years back, Safdar Jung had big role to play in defeating Abdali. So there was bad blood."

**The Challenge:**
> "Najib Khan has to do lot of hard work to change Suja's mind because he was predisposed to not joining Abdali because of prior background of father fighting Abdali. There was bad blood and Abdali was defeated in that thing."

**The Mental Block:**
> "To reverse that mental block that Suja had, Najib Khan has to work very hard to change that mentality."

---

## The Delicate Negotiations

**Abdali's Understanding:**
> "These negotiations are so delicate. It cannot be dealt with by sending professional lawyers or diplomats, messengers or via letter."

**Why In-Person Mattered:**
- Mental block can't be removed by letter
- Can't send professional diplomats
- **Has to be one-on-one heart-to-heart** conversation in person
- Or else no deal
- Somebody of important stature
- Otherwise Suja won't move from mental position "I don't trust this guy"

**Why This Was Critical:**
> "That's why it was critical that Najib Khan along with some people goes to visit Suja-ud-Daula."

---

## Bhau Crosses Chambar (Month of June 1760)

**The Event:**
> "In month of June 1760, Bhau had crossed Chambar river."

**The Problem:**
- Chambar is **small-time river**
- "River by any stretch of imagination"
- **Took him about a month to cross**

**The Implications:**
> "If he takes month to cross Chambar, how long will it take to cross Yamuna? Yamuna is huge river."

**The Reality:**
> "Marathas did not master technique of crossing rivers."

**The Contrast:**
- Abdali crossed many rivers from Afghanistan to Doab
- With elephants, camels, horses, donkeys, cannons, people
- Thousands and thousands
- "How do you take elephant across river? That's special case, tough one, camel even."
- Somehow found a way out
- **But Marathas did not**

---

## The Monsoon Problem

**The Timing:**
> "By mid or end of June, he crossed Chambar finally. Monsoon had begun."

**Why This Mattered:**
- Early June: monsoon begins
- Whole earth is soggy
- **Not meant for armies to be on march**
- All rivers have flooded

**The Historical Pattern:**
> "Nobody did that in India ever because generally armies went to battle probably by November."

**The Situation:**
- Very difficult
- Soggy earth
- Animals can't walk properly
- Bullock carts - how do you drive when earth is soggy?
- Huge army: 80,000+ people
- Plus 50-60,000 civilians
- **Like big village moving** from one place to another

---

## Bhau Hadn't Met Holkar Yet

**The Problem:**
- Malhar Rao Holkar stationed on **outskirts of Delhi**
- Got "zapped" by Abdali's forces
- Didn't want to be in thick of things
- Staying a little bit outside main areas

**What Bhau Missed:**
> "Had he met with Holkar, he would be even more in know of how things were in north."

**Why:**
- Holkar had met Abdali's forces in battlefield
- Not Abdali personally, but Afghan army units
- Could tell things to Bhau
- **But they hadn't met** due to physical distance

**The Distance:**
- Chambar crossing means Bhau still **400-500 kilometers away**

---

## Bhau's Plan: Get to Doab

**The Strategy:**
> "Bhau wanted to get into Doab. That means he has to cross Yamuna. There is no other way."

**Why Itawa:**
- Only **Maratha-held city in Doab**
- If he goes to Itawa, wants to meet Suja
- His plan was to do battle **in Doab itself**

**The Urgency:**
> "Immediately without waiting several months. Because that's why they were going to north. There was no other purpose but to fight this battle."

**The Follow-Up:**
- Then go to Delhi
- Settle issues in Delhi
- Reinstall previous blinded personality as emperor
- Make Suja-ud-Daula new wazir

---

## After Chambar Crossing

**What Bhau Did:**
- Crossed Chambar (north of it now)
- Chambar goes east-west
- Now on other side
- **Camped out**
- **Waited for commanders to join him**
- To decide how to go forward
- What strategies to apply

---

## Key Figures

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| **Suja-ud-Daula** | Confused, tilting both ways |
| **Sadrunisa Begum** | His mother, favored Marathas |
| **Muhammad Shah's widow** | Childhood friend of Sadrunisa, sent by Abdali |
| **Najib Khan** | Abdali's personal emissary, "as good as Abdali" |
| **Jahan Khan** | Abdali's commander, couldn't convince Suja alone |
| **Govindapant Bundele** | Sent to Sadrunisa, got no assurances |
| **Malhar Rao Holkar** | On Delhi outskirts, hadn't met Bhau yet |

---

## Major Themes

### 1. The Diplomatic Arms Race
Each side escalating who they send. Started with letters, messengers, then important commanders, finally Najib Khan (Abdali's right hand).

### 2. The Power of Personal Relationships
Childhood friend > professional diplomat. Heart-to-heart > letter writing. Personal touch matters.

### 3. The River Crossing Disaster
One month for tiny Chambar. Impossible for huge Yamuna. Maratha fatal weakness exposed.

### 4. The Bad Blood Factor
Safdar Jung defeated Abdali in past. Creates mental block for Suja. Hard to overcome.

### 5. The Timing Catastrophe
Monsoon makes everything worse. Soggy earth, flooded rivers, can't move properly. "Nobody did that in India ever."

### 6. The Male Power Structure
Sadrunisa favors Marathas but can't force decision. Male-dominated system limits her influence.

## Geographic Context

- **Chambar River:** Small river, took month to cross
- **Yamuna River:** Huge river, need to cross for Doab
- **Itawa:** Only Maratha city in Doab
- **Doab:** Target - where battle should happen
- **Delhi Outskirts:** Where Holkar stationed

---

**Where we left off:** Diplomatic escalation at fever pitch. Bhau sent Govindapant to Sadrunisa (got nothing). Abdali sent childhood friend (worked better). Then Jahan Khan. Still not enough. Finally Abdali sends Najib Khan - his personal confidant, "as good as Abdali himself" - for heart-to-heart talk with Suja. Meanwhile Bhau struggling with rivers: took MONTH to cross tiny Chambar. Monsoon making everything worse. Still 400-500km away. Hadn't even met Holkar yet. And Yamuna crossing looming - the big one. Bad blood between Safdar Jung and Abdali making Suja suspicious. But Najib Khan coming for ultimate diplomatic push.

---

*The diplomatic war intensifies while Bhau crawls north through monsoon floods. One month for Chambar. Yamuna still ahead. Abdali's final weapon: Najib Khan, the personal emissary who is "like one" with Abdali. Heart-to-heart diplomacy vs distant promises. Childhood friends vs mother's advice. Proximity vs logic. Geography vs history. And somewhere in all this, Suja must decide: Afghan vs Indian? Or Hindu vs Muslim?*
