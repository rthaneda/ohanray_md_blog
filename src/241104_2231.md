## The Escape Plan

### The Brilliant Strategy

**How They Did It:**

1. **Put on Kizilbad dress** - Jawahar Singh, Antaji Mankeshwar, Samsher Bahadur, and few others
2. **Through the tunnel** - Escaped via hidden tunnel in the fort
3. **Came out of the fort** - Emerged outside
4. **Mixed with Shah's army** - Blended right in
5. **Looked like Kizilbads** - No one suspected them
6. **Found a way out** - Gradually moved away
7. **Escaped to Yamuna River** - Headed east

### The Hiding Place

**The Ravine:**
- There's a **ravine** near the Yamuna River
- Natural hiding spot
- Difficult to spot people there
- They hid in this ravine
- Later fled from there

**The Result:**

- Barely survived
- Clever use of disguise
- Knowledge of tunnel was crucial

## Who Was Samsher Bahadur?

### The Connection to Bajirao I

**His Identity:**
- Son of **Bajirao I** (the great Peshwa)
- Mother was **Mastani**

**Why He Was Ostracized:**

1. **Mother wasn't Hindu** - Mastani was Muslim
2. **Marriage not recognized** - Not done according to Hindu rites
3. **Not considered lawful wife** - By Pune/Maratha society
4. **Conservative society** - Very strict at the time
5. **Never in Peshwa hierarchy** - Not allowed to succeed

**Where He Lived:**
- Mother lived in Pune
- **Across the river** - Separate from main family
- Had a bungalow
- **Never considered part of the family**

**His Name:**
- **Samsher** = His given name
- **Bahadur** = "The Brave" (title)
- Fighting to prove himself despite his outcast status

## The Kizilbads: Abdali's Death Squad

### Why They Were So Effective

**The Status:**
- Personal slaves of Abdali
- No personal autonomy
- Life belonged to master
- Ultimate loyalty

**The Mentality:**
- Suicidal courage
- No hesitation
- No self-preservation instinct
- Would die without question
- "Because they were slaves, their life didn't matter"

**The Advantage:**
- Fearless fighters
- Perfect for impossible missions
- No moral questioning
- Complete obedience

**The Identification:**
- Unique dress/uniform
- Everyone could recognize them
- Showed they were elite

## The Tunnel System

### Why Forts Had Secret Exits

**The Purpose:**
1. **Last resort escape** - When all is lost
2. **Secret communication** - Messages in/out
3. **Surprise attacks** - Exit and attack from behind
4. **Supply lines** - During long sieges
5. **Leadership survival** - Save the command structure

**Common in Indian Forts:**
- Most major forts had tunnels
- Secret passages
- Hidden exits
- Known only to leadership
- Crucial for survival

**Vallabhgarh's Tunnel:**
- Led outside the fort
- Exit point unknown to attackers
- Allowed escape during the assault
- Saved the leadership

---

## The Military Innovation: Arc-Trajectory Cannons

### The Technology

**How It Worked:**
- Point cannon **toward sky**
- Doesn't aim directly at walls
- **Arc trajectory** - goes up and comes down
- Drops on target from above
- Can hit inside fort walls

**The Advantage:**
- Fort walls protect from direct fire
- But can't protect from **overhead bombardment**
- Like modern artillery/mortars
- Revolutionary for the time

**The Shrapnel Effect:**
- Cannonball **splits into two parts**
- Or breaks apart on impact
- Pieces thrown around
- Multiple casualties from single shot
- Psychological terror

---

## Key Themes

1. **Personal Leadership** - Abdali personally directed the siege
2. **Technological Superiority** - Arc-trajectory cannons devastated defense
3. **The Payment System** - 8 rupees per head continues
4. **Brilliant Escape** - Disguise as enemy's elite force
5. **Tunnel Knowledge** - Secret exits save leadership
6. **Slave Soldiers** - Kizilbads as ultimate loyal force
7. **Capture vs. Kill** - Wanted leaders alive/dead, not just victory
8. **The Outcast Warrior** - Samsher Bahadur proving himself despite origins
9. **Systematic Destruction** - Massacre after conquest
10. **Leadership Survival** - Fight another day

---

## The Irony

### The Kizilbad Disguise

**The Perfect Camouflage:**
- Abdali's most loyal troops
- Everyone recognizes the uniform
- No one questions a Kizilbad
- Absolute trust in their loyalty

**The Exploit:**
- That trust becomes vulnerability
- The distinctive uniform = escape pass
- Walk right through enemy lines
- "Look like us = must be one of us"
- Perfect disguise because it's unthinkable

**The Parallel:**
- Like a prisoner disguising as a guard
- The uniform that means "most loyal"
- Used by the enemy to escape
- Brilliant psychological warfare

## The Broader Campaign

### The Pattern Emerges

**Late January 1757: Abdali personally directs the siege. Arc-trajectory cannons rain down for two hours. The fort's defenses crumble. Doors are cut down. The massacre begins. But the leaders - disguised as Abdali's own elite Kizilbads - slip through a secret tunnel, walk right through enemy lines, and escape to a ravine by the Yamuna. They survive to fight another day. But Vallabhgarh has fallen. And Mathura lies completely unprotected. The worst massacre in Indian history is about to begin...**
