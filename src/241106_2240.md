# Nature's Revenge: Cholera, Retreat & Defiance (Late February-March 1757)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Aftermath

### The Destruction Complete (Recap)

**What Just Happened:**
- Mathura massacred for a week
- Yamuna red with blood, then yellow
- Systematic genocide
- Continued toward Agra
- Then Abdali crossed back to Gokul

---

## Gokul: The Second Holy Site

### Across the Yamuna

**The Geography:**
- **Mathura** - Western bank of Yamuna (Krishna's birthplace)
- **Gokul** - Eastern bank of Yamuna (where Krishna grew up)
- Abdali crossed the river

**Religious Significance:**
- Where Krishna's father landed after crossing the Yamuna
- Where river waters receded for him
- Where Krishna spent his childhood
- As a teenager
- Also a very holy site

**The Temple:**
- **Gokul Nath Mandir** (temple)
- Major religious site

---

## The Fight at Gokul

### The Naga Sadhus

**Who Defended:**
- **Naga Sadhus** - Warrior ascetics
- Carried swords
- Put up resistance
- Fought back

**The Battle:**
- They put up a fight
- But they were **all killed**
- No match for professional army
- Not enough of them

---

## Why the Temple Was Spared

### The Economics of Destruction

**Abdali's Calculation:**
- His real interest was **looting**
- Gokul had **nothing to loot**
- Ascetic people - no wealth
- Maybe some other people, but not much
- Didn't find enough to make it worth staying

**The Decision:**
- Just **returned back**
- Didn't destroy Gokul Nath temple
- Didn't stay there long
- Would have taken too long to destroy it
- Wasn't worth the effort

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows his priorities: **Wealth > Destruction**
- Religious destruction was secondary
- If there's no profit, don't waste time
- Mathura got destroyed because of wealth + symbolism
- Gokul spared because nothing to gain

---

## The Treatment of Muslims

### Not Completely Spared

**What Happened to Mathura Muslims:**
- **Lives were spared** - They weren't killed
- **But:** Had to lose their money
- Property confiscated
- Probably subjected to humiliation/insults
- "Didn't get too much special treatment"

**The Message:**
- Being Muslim helped you survive
- But didn't save your wealth
- Still got looted
- Just not murdered

---

## The Goldsmith's Story

### 14 Days Later

**The Survivor:**
- Found after **14 days** of destruction
- **No clothes** on his body
- Completely bare
- Begging
- Someone saw him and he told his story

### His Account

**His Life Before:**
> "I was a goldsmith. I had a big shop."

**The Attack:**
- During the massacre
- Cavalry guy came
- With an **open sword** (no sheath)
- On horseback
- Came to kill him

**The Exchange:**

**Goldsmith:** "I'm a Muslim!"

**Cavalry guy:** "Show me the proof."

**Goldsmith:** [Took off his clothes - circumcision proof]

**Cavalry guy:** "Give me all your money. That's the only way you can save your life."

**But Then:**
- Another guy came
- **Struck his stomach with a sword**
- Despite being shown he was Muslim
- Didn't care about the negotiation

**His Escape:**
- Ran away
- Hid in some corners
- Survived
- But lost everything
- Naked, wounded, traumatized

**The Lesson:**
- Even Muslims weren't safe from all violence
- Some soldiers didn't care
- Chaos and brutality everywhere
- Being Muslim helped odds but wasn't guarantee

---

## A Writer's Description

### The Pitable State

**What Was Seen:**

**The Bodies:**
- Corpses everywhere you look
- Lots of corpses on the streets

**The Blood:**
- So much blood on the streets
- **Difficult to walk** through
- Had to navigate around blood and bodies

**The Beheadings:**
- Many corpses had no head
- Someone counted **200 headless bodies**
- Just in one area

**The Smell:**
- Stench was **unbearable**
- Couldn't open your mouth
- Couldn't take a breath normally
- **Everyone walking had to keep handkerchief on mouth**
- Be careful how they breathed

---

## Abdali's Victory Poem

### Commissioning the Propaganda

**Abdali's Request:**
> "I want a small poem constructed to commemorate this event. Is there somebody who can come up with this?"

**What It Should Say:**
- "I have relieved the **pollution caused by the kafirs**"
- "Look how much I've done"
- Celebrate the "achievement"
- Commemorate the massacre

**The Response:**
- After **two days**
- Guy called **Khawas Khan**
- Constructed a few lines
- Basically said: "Mr. Abdali has established peace in India"
- Something celebratory
- Whitewashing the genocide as "peace"

**The Irony:**
- Genocide = "relieved pollution"
- Massacre = "established peace"
- Mass murder = "achievement"
- Propaganda poem to celebrate horror

---

## The Agra Fort

### Why It Wasn't Taken

**The Defense:**
- Fort walls had **cannons mounted**
- Well protected
- Jahan Khan and forces couldn't take it over
- **Couldn't easily do a siege**

**The Reason:**
- Unlike Mathura (undefended religious site)
- Agra Fort was military installation
- Proper defenses
- Would take too long
- Not worth the effort

---

## NATURE'S REVENGE: The Cholera Outbreak

### The Cause

**What Triggered It:**
> "The unbearable situation of normal people in Mathura and Agra was finally resolved by **nature itself**."

**How:**
- **Thousands of dead bodies**
- River water became **polluted**
- Yamuna water contaminated
- Started **cholera epidemic**

**Where It Started:**
- In the **camp and tents of Abdali's forces**
- His own army got hit first
- Poetic justice

---

## The Disease Strikes

### What Cholera Meant

**In 1757:**
- **No vaccination**
- **No treatment**
- Once you contracted it: **You are dead**
- Death sentence
- No way to save yourself

### The Death Toll

**Daily Deaths:**
- **150 soldiers dying every day**
- In Jahan Khan's army
- In Abdali's forces
- Massive casualties
- From their own actions

**The Impact:**
- Big problem for Abdali
- Losing more soldiers to disease than to battle
- Army weakening rapidly
- Can't stay much longer

---

## The Decision to Retreat

### Time to Leave

**Why Abdali Left:**

1. **Looted everything** he wanted ✓
2. **Created massive scare** ✓
3. **Almost all objectives met** ✓
4. **Cholera outbreak** - Really scared him and his forces
5. **Wanted to get out** before losing more soldiers

**The Invitation to Jahan Khan:**
- Abdali invited Jahan Khan back
- Decided to return to Afghanistan
- "Country mother country" = His homeland
- Time to go home with the loot

---

## The Final Shakedown Attempt

### Surajmal's Three Forts

**On the Way Back:**
- Abdali threatened Surajmal Jat
- Demanded **Pandani** (some amount of money)
- In return: Won't destroy **three of Surajmal's forts**
- Last-ditch attempt to collect more loot
- Even while retreating

**The Tactic:**
- One final threat
- "Pay up or lose your forts"
- Trying to extract maximum wealth
- Before leaving India

---

## Surajmal's Defiant Response

### The Calculation

**What Surajmal Knew:**
- Abdali's army is suffering from **cholera epidemic**
- Not in fierce fighting mode
- Weakened
- Desperate to leave
- This is a **bluff**

**His Decision:**
- Instead of giving anything
- Wrote a **long letter**
- **Frank** - no proper reverence
- Didn't respect Abdali at all
- Had nothing to worry about now

---

## THE LETTER: Bold Defiance

### The Tone

**Usually in Letters:**
- Use respectful language
- Proper reverence
- Careful wording
- Diplomatic

**Surajmal's Letter:**
- **No such feeling**
- Wrote it frankly
- No respect
- Direct and challenging
- Because he knew Abdali was weak

### The Content

**What He Wrote:**

> "Whichever forts you think are weak and soft targets that you can easily grab - **we will show how strong they are during battle**."

**Translation:**
- Go ahead, attack
- We will see what happens
- I'm not afraid
- Bring it on

**The Historical Reference:**

> "With God's grace, these forts are at least as strong as **Sikandar's fort**."

**Who Was Sikandar:**
- Historical king from Persia
- Had come to India long ago
- Known for having extremely strong forts
- Historical reference to invincibility

**The Message:**
> "You shouldn't have any ideas about attacking my forts. They're as strong as legendary forts. Try me."

## The Irony

### Multiple Layers

**Irony #1: Nature's Revenge**
- Abdali creates thousands of corpses
- Corpses pollute the water
- Pollution causes cholera
- Cholera kills his own soldiers
- His atrocities become his problem

**Irony #2: The Victory Poem**
- Commissions poem about "establishing peace"
- While retreating due to disease
- From bodies of his victims
- "Peace" = genocide
- Disease = consequence of his "victory"

**Irony #3: The Failed Shakedown**
- Tries one more extortion
- But weakened by cholera
- Surajmal sees through it
- Responds with defiance
- Victor becomes supplicant

**Irony #4: The Temple Saved**
- Mathura destroyed (wealthy)
- Gokul spared (poor)
- Wealth attracted destruction
- Poverty became protection
- Economics trumped ideology

---

## The Power Shift

### From Terror to Defiance

**Before:**
- Everyone terrified of Abdali
- Paid whatever he demanded
- No one dared resist
- Complete domination

**Now:**
- Surajmal writing frank letter
- No respect, no fear
- Challenging him directly
- "Go ahead, attack"

**Why the Change:**
- Cholera weakened the army
- 150 soldiers dying daily
- Need to retreat
- Lost the aura of invincibility
- Desperation showing

---

## The Cholera Epidemic

### How It Worked

**The Transmission:**
1. Thousands of dead bodies
2. Many thrown in Yamuna River
3. Water becomes polluted
4. Army drinks polluted water
5. Cholera spreads through camp
6. No immunity, no treatment
7. Death sentence for infected

**Why It Hit Them Hard:**
- Living in close quarters (camps)
- All drinking same water source
- No sanitation
- No medical care
- Disease spreads fast
- Can't escape it

**The Daily Toll:**
- 150 deaths per day
- Probably 1,000+ total over weeks
- Lost more to disease than to Marathas
- Weakened the army severely

---

## Key Themes

1. **Nature's Justice** - Dead bodies cause disease that kills perpetrators
2. **Economics > Ideology** - Gokul spared because nothing to loot
3. **Defiance Emerges** - Surajmal's frank letter shows power shift
4. **Propaganda vs Reality** - Victory poem while retreating from disease
5. **The Long Con Fails** - Last shakedown attempt doesn't work
6. **Muslims Not Fully Safe** - Even co-religionists get attacked
7. **Disease as Equalizer** - Cholera doesn't care about military might
8. **The Cost of Atrocities** - Actions have consequences
9. **Forced Retreat** - Victory hollow when forced to flee disease
10. **Historical Parallels** - Surajmal invokes Sikandar's legendary forts

---

## The Muslims' Treatment

### A Note on "Sparing"

**What "Spared" Meant:**
- Not killed (usually)
- But lost all wealth
- Subjected to insults
- Probably roughed up
- Not totally exempt

**The Goldsmith's Story Shows:**
- Identity verification required (circumcision)
- Even then, not fully safe
- Different soldiers had different rules
- Chaos meant anything could happen
- Being Muslim helped odds but wasn't foolproof

---

## The Poem: Propaganda Machine

### Whitewashing Genocide

**What Actually Happened:**
- Mass murder of civilians
- Week-long bloodbath
- Targeting religious sites
- Children beheaded
- Women drowned themselves

**What the Poem Said:**
- "Relieved pollution of kafirs"
- "Established peace"
- Something "celebratory"
- Made it sound noble

**The Purpose:**
- Control the narrative
- Make genocide seem righteous
- Justify atrocities
- Create heroic image
- For posterity and supporters

---

## Historical Significance

1. Will Abdali come back?
2. When will Marathas respond?
3. How long until the showdown?
4. Can Marathas unite the North?
5. What will Najib Khan do as Wazir?

---

**The Message:**
- Actions have consequences
- Can't escape them
- Nature itself becomes avenger
- No immunity for victors

---

**March 1757: The massacre is complete. Gokul's temple stands because there's nothing to loot. A Muslim goldsmith survives 14 days, naked and wounded, to tell his story. Abdali commissions a poem: "I relieved the pollution of kafirs and established peace." But thousands of bodies pollute the Yamuna. Cholera erupts in Afghan camps. 150 soldiers dying daily. Abdali decides to retreat. On the way out, tries to extort Surajmal one last time. Surajmal writes back: "Go ahead, attack my forts. They're as strong as Sikandar's legendary fortresses. Try me." Nature's revenge is complete. The tyrant retreats, weakened by disease born from his own atrocities. But the news is spreading to Pune. The Marathas are mobilizing. And Abdali will return. The path to Panipat is inevitable now.**
