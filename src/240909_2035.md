# Abdali's Attack on Punjab (1751)
## Why War Became Inevitable

---

## The Situation Escalates

The tension between the **Marathas** and **Afghans** (Abdali's forces) was reaching its peak - things were becoming very predictable. War was clearly coming.

### The Peshwa Was Sleeping 💤

**Problem:** Down in Pune (deep south compared to Delhi), the Peshwa had **no inkling** this was coming.

- He wasn't giving the northern situation proper attention
- Totally oblivious that this massive struggle was about to break out
- While everyone up north could see war was inevitable, the Peshwa was clueless

## The Rohilla Problem: An Existential Crisis

### Who Are the Rohillas?

**Rohillas** = Afghan soldiers of fortune who had developed their own kingdom in **Rohilkhand** (region in northern India)

**Their Ambitions:**
- Saw the power vacuum in the Mughal Empire
- The Emperor was just a puppet (everyone knew this)
- Wanted to establish their own power and have their own viziers
- Were getting increasingly ambitious

### The One Problem: Marathas

**The Realization:**
1. Safdar Jung was vizier (temporary figure)
2. When Marathas sided with him, they **defeated the Rohillas at several places around Delhi**
3. Rohillas realized: **"We are no match for the Marathas"**
4. Bigger realization: **"There is NOBODY in the north who can match Maratha power"**

### The Existential Crisis

**The Muslim Perspective:**
- Muslims had ruled India for **200-300 years** (first various Sultans, then Mughals)
- They had developed a complete **stranglehold on all of North India**
- Now they realized: **"We are about to lose this entire thing"**
- The Marathas were too powerful
- The Rohillas (Afghan army) saw themselves as the **last safeguarding army for Islam**

**The Math:**
- If Rohillas can't match Marathas → Muslims lose everything
- Mughals will be evicted eventually
- What happens to us then?

## The Only Solution: Invite Abdali

### Why Abdali Was Perfect

**The Rohillas' Strategy:**
- Look to Ahmad Shah Abdali for help
- Rohillas were originally from Afghanistan anyway - natural allies
- **Critical advantage:** If they invite Abdali, he's not coming as a complete outsider without allies

**Abdali's Calculation:**
- Without internal allies: High risk, might face lots of pushback
- **With internal allies (Rohillas + internal Mughals):** Much more secure, fearless
- He LOVES having internal allies

**The Inevitable Conclusion:**
- Internal Mughals and Rohillas could not handle Marathas
- They could only look up to **ONE man and one man only**
- That was **Abdali**
- Marathas were becoming stronger by the day
- Abdali was the **only fair match** - everyone else was going to fall

### What About the Rajputs?

The Rajputs had become **weak** - basically "jokers" at this point. They were Hindus, so they wouldn't really fight with the Marathas anyway.

**Conclusion:** It was becoming apparent that Abdali and Marathas were going to battle - it was just a matter of time.

## Chapter: Abdali's Attack on Punjab

### Why Punjab?

**Geographic Context:**
- **Punjab** = "Land of Five Rivers"
- Four rivers empty into the **Sindhu River** (Indus)
- Once they merge, Sindhu becomes massive
- Creates **tremendously fertile land** all around it

**Strategic Value:**
- Extremely fertile province
- Prosperous agriculture
- Lots of taxes levied on farmers
- **Westernmost province of the Mughal Empire**
- Closer to Afghanistan - "doable distance"

**Abdali's Goal:** Make Punjab an Afghan province, even though it was squarely within Mughal territory.

## Abdali's Justification

### His Quote:

> **"For the last four months, Muslims have been killing each other. Will Allah accept this?"**

Abdali was positioning himself as concerned about Muslim infighting.

## Abdali Consolidates Afghanistan First: The Herat Campaign

### Background on Afghanistan

**Herat:**
- Westernmost city of Afghanistan
- Lots of **Shia Afghans** living there (deeply influenced by nearby Iran)
- Kabul and Kandahar were far from Iran - had Pashtun tribes (majority of Afghan population)

**Historical Context:**
- Iran at one time controlled about **half of Afghanistan**
- Under **Nadir Shah**, Iran had total reign
- At that time, Afghanistan wasn't even a separate nation
- Western side was controlled by Nadir Shah

### Abdali's Consolidation (September 1748 - 1751)

**What He Did:**
- Spent about **3 years** taking over Herat
- Put Afghanistan together as a unified nation
- Claimed Herat as part of Afghanistan
- **Kicked out all Iranian influence** from the region

**Result:** By 1751, Herat was squarely within his control.

**His Thinking:** "Okay, west is secured. Now let me go east and take over Punjab."

## The Reparations Dispute

### Background: The Previous Agreement

**The Players:**
- **Mir Manu** = Mughal commander/Subedar of Punjab
- **Diwan Kaura Mall** = Hindu Subedar of Multan (small town in Punjab)

**The Deal:**
- Last time Abdali came, he demanded taxes from Punjab
- Wazir said: "I'm not coming to help you, do whatever you want"
- Mir Manu had to negotiate a truce
- Agreed to pay **khandani** (reparations/yearly sum) to Abdali
- Like what Germany had to pay after WWI

### The Problem: Mughals Went Back on Their Word

**What Happened:**
- When Mughals felt stronger, they'd say "we didn't agree to anything"
- They kept going back and forth
- **Diwan Kaura Mall** advised Mir Manu: **"Don't give it to Abdali"**
- Mir Manu stopped paying

**Abdali's Response:**
- Got irate - "It was agreed upon, now it's not coming?"
- "Okay, let me go teach them a lesson about who's boss"
- Also had to deal with Nasir Khan (previous Subedar) and Mughal attempts to retake Kabul
- Realized they were doing "hanky-panky"

## The Military Campaign Begins: November 1751

### Abdali's Strategy

**The Approach:**
1. Sent **two commanders forward** (Jahan Khan and Samad Khan)
2. **He himself** led the main force through the **Khyber Pass**

### The Khyber Pass

**Geographic Importance:**
- Famous mountain pass between Afghanistan and Pakistan
- Big mountain range with this pass cutting through
- Once you cross through → you reach the plains at **Peshawar**
- Today Peshawar is in Pakistan
- At that time: **contested between Afghans and Mughals** (but mostly in Mughal hands)

**What Happened:**
- Abdali crossed through Khyber Pass
- Came to Peshawar in **November 1751**
- Ready to fall upon the Mughals

---

## The Final Negotiation Attempt

### One Last Chance

**Haroon Khan** (Abdali's representative) met with **Muin ul-Mulk** (Mughal commander)

**The Ask:** Pay the reparations you owe to Abdali

**Muin's Response:**
- âŒ **REJECTED** the reparation offer completely
- Immediately started war preparations
- The war was now **unavoidable** (ataar)

### Smart Prep Move

**Before war breaks out:**
- Muin moved his **mother, wife, and daughter** into a mountainous area where they'd be secure
- Smart thinking - don't have to worry about family when fighting

---

## The Confrontation Setup

### The Standoff at Ravi River

**The Position:**
- **Ravi River** = one of the tributaries that empties into Sindhu
- Muin was coming from the Mughal side
- He **crossed Ravi River**
- **Dug in his position** on the other side with his entire army
- Waiting for Abdali to confront him

## The Big Picture

### Why This All Matters

1. **The Rohillas' Existential Crisis** made Abdali's invitation inevitable
2. **Muslim rulers' vulnerability** to rising Maratha power created desperation
3. **Internal allies** transformed Abdali from foreign raider to welcomed champion
4. **Punjab's wealth and fertility** made it the perfect prize
5. **Mughal weakness** (going back on agreements) invited aggression
6. **The Peshwa's obliviousness** meant Marathas weren't preparing for what was coming

### The Setup Is Complete

- Abdali has secured his western flank (Herat)
- He has internal allies (Rohillas + disgruntled Mughals)
- He has legitimate grievances (unpaid reparations)
- He has his army at Peshawar
- The Mughal forces are dug in at Ravi River
- The Marathas down south have no idea what's brewing

**The collision course is set. War is unavoidable.**
