# Army Speed Debate & The Contradictory Letters (June 1760)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The 18th Century Army Speed Defense

### Marg Akraman - The Rate of March

**What It Means:**
- **Marg** = path
- **Akraman** = traversing on the path
- Talking about "the time it took to cover x miles"

**The Author's Point:**
> "Basically in the 18th century the army used to travel at the rates that he already mentioned. That was the normal practice. That's what he is saying."

**The Comparison:**
- On par with 17th century armies
- On par with 18th century armies
- This was just **how armies moved**

---

## The Dholpur Stop: One Month Explained

### Why He Stopped

**The Duration:**
> "Even if we consider his rate or speed, or considering the fact that he stayed or camped at Dholpur for one month..."

**Why One Month?**
> "He was waiting for certain factions or some contingents to come there so that he can decide upon his diplomatic reach, the kingdom, how to go."

**The Purpose:**
- **Deliberations**
- Strategic planning
- Waiting for different groups to arrive
- Diplomatic coordination
- "Now I recall" - this was mentioned before

**The Verdict:**
> "But even considering that one month, he still was on par with what armies used to travel in the 18th century in terms of their speed."

**The Conclusion:**
> "He wasn't so far behind on that front."

## Nana Fadnavis's Report from Sirhonj

### Writing to His Uncle

**Who Wrote:**
- **Nana Fadnavis** (or Fadni)
- From **Sirhonj**
- To **his uncle**
- About "what was happening there"

---

## The Pathan Moves: Ramgad Taken

### The Report

**What Happened:**
> "Pathan came to Ramgad, which they took away from Jat - so that is Sureshwar Jat."

- Pathans (Afghans) took Ramgad
- It was previously controlled by Sureshwar Jat
- Now in Afghan hands

---

## The Siege of Itawa

### Maratha Stronghold Under Pressure

**Itawa:**
- A city
- **Maratha stronghold**
- Had Maratha presence there

**What Happened:**
> "Najib Khan and Jahan Khan basically laid a siege (morche) so that Marathas won't be able to reinforce their troops or do any such thing."

**The Strategy:**
- Cut off reinforcements
- Isolate the Maratha garrison
- Prevent supply lines
- Trap them inside

---

## Hafiz Rahimat Khan: The Peace Offering?

### The Rohilla Overture

**Who He Was:**
- Another **Rohilla commander**
- Different from Najib Khan
- Senior Rohilla figure

**What He Did:**
> "He may have come to see if he can switch Sureshwar Jat from his new priority position towards Abdali."

**Salukha:**
- Means **reconciliation**
- "But reconciliation with whom?"
- Speculating: **with Abdali**
- Trying to negotiate

**The Mission:**
- Came to Sureshwar Jat
- On behalf of Abdali
- Saying "let's negotiate and find a way out"
- Peace overture

---

## The Two-Faced Game

### The Contradiction

**On One Hand:**
- Hafiz Rahimat Khan offering reconciliation
- "Let's talk, let's negotiate"
- Peace feelers

**On The Other Hand:**
- Najib Khan and Jahan Khan planning to attack
- Maratha presence in Itawa under siege
- Active military operations

**The Assessment:**
> "So he's saying that their actions don't jive. They're playing a two-faced game. They cannot be believable or they cannot be trusted."

**The Conclusion:**
- Afghans/Rohillas not acting in good faith
- Peace talks = stalling tactic?
- Or genuine split between Rohilla commanders?
- Can't trust them

---

## Nana's Strategic Advice

### Waiting for Bhau

**The Letter Closes:**
> "Proper action or deliberations will be done once Bhau gets into Mathura."

**The Plan:**
- Wait for Bhau to reach Mathura
- Mathura on the banks of Yamuna
- Take appropriate actions then
- Coordinate strategy once he arrives

---

## June 4, 1760: Departing Gwalior

### The March Continues

**The Location:**
> "4th of June 1760, Bhau started off from Gwalior. Today it is in Madhya Pradesh."

**The Route:**
- Left Gwalior
- Crossed a small river on 4th of June
- Came to the banks of **Chambar river**

---

## The Chambar River: Tributary to Yamuna

### Why This Matters

**Upanadi:**
- Means **tributary**
- Chambar = tributary to the Yamuna

**The Situation:**
> "He now is on the banks of Chambar river. And he has to cross it in order to get to Yamuna or to Mathura."

---

## The Chambar Crossing Problem

### Multiple Issues

**Problem #1: Monsoon**
> "The problem with crossing Chambar is first and foremost now the monsoon is coming or is already there."

**The Timing:**
> "4th of June is not too far away from 7th of June" (when monsoon typically begins)

**Problem #2: Ravines on Both Banks**
> "Chambar river, both the banks were not horizontal. There are ravines all over the banks - it's not a flat land."

**What This Means:**
- Can't just walk up onto the bank from the river
- Ravines = steep gullies and cliffs
- "Small ravines and stuff"
- Difficult terrain

**Problem #3: The Cannons**
> "So you can't really bring these huge cannons through there."

**The Challenge:**
> "It was difficult because he has to carry all the cannons and elephants. Everything has to go across the river. And that's where he got bogged down."

---

## How Long It Took: 8-10 Days

### The Struggle

**The Duration:**
> "It took him like 8-10 days to cross Chambar."

**By June 8, 1760:**
- Finally crossed Chambar
- Came **south of Dholpur**
- Entered **Jat territory**

**Dholpur:**
- Part of Jat territory
- Sureshwar Jat's domain

---

## The Shivaji Connection

### The Same Road

**Historical Echo:**
> "Dholpur also was - Shivaji also passed through Dholpur on his way back [from Agra]. That's where he said 'I am Shivaji.'"

**Narvar Gati:**
- Little bit south of Dholpur
- Where the famous declaration happened

**The Route:**
> "So the road was the same road actually. When you are going from south to north or north to south, there were not too many roads you can take."

**The Infrastructure:**
- Only one main route
- "One of one"
- "Rough roads - not really concrete or anything"
- "Not quality"

---

## Now in Jat Territory

### Meeting Sureshwar Jat

**The Location:**
> "Now he is in Jat territory. Sureshwar Jat - that is his territory now. So he may meet with him or talk to him."

---

## Forces Converging: End of June

### The Merger Begins

**South of Dholpur:**
- Bhau got together with [someone from] Dholpur

**End of June:**
> "Jankoji Shinde and the Shinde army joined him."

**The Result:**
> "So now it's all coming together - into one big group."

---

## Understanding Maratha Confederacy

### The Political Structure

**What It Was:**
> "You have to understand, Maratha rule was a confederacy. Confederacy means the Marathas, they were split into different factions."

**The Geographic Distribution:**
- One faction in **Indore**
- One in **Gwalior**
- One around **Delhi**
- One in **Gujarat**

**The Command Structure:**
> "All these, they have their own separate commanders. But they all reported to Nanasaheb Peshwa."

**The Freedom:**
> "In their own areas they had some amount of freedom."

**Why:**
> "The acreage or the geographical extent was so big that Peshwa could not say that all of them is my rule. It just wouldn't work."

**The Parallel:**
> "Even Mughals were the same way - they had their own vassal kings and stuff like that."

---

## The Intelligence Exchange

### What Holkar and Shinde Knew

**The Information:**
> "Now Holkar and Shinde, they were aware of what negotiations were taking place between Hafiz Rehman Khan and Mr. Jat."

**What They Did:**
> "They informed Bhau of what those negotiations were, how they were going on."

**Why It Mattered:**
> "Because it was important - if there was something that Bhau can pick up on, if Abdali is willing to compromise or there is something that they can agree upon, then it would turn into a different mission."

**The Hope:**
- Maybe avoid battle
- Find diplomatic solution
- If Abdali willing to negotiate
- Change the whole mission

---

## The Kaifiyat: Bhau's Personal Record

### What It Is

**Kaifiyat:**
> "It's kind of Bhau is talking. His story. Somebody wrote up his story or as though he is telling what he was going through each and every day of the campaign."

**Like An Autobiography:**
> "Kaifiyat is actually his own daily diary, you can say."

**Who Wrote It:**
> "Somebody was writing because basically he was not writing at all because he has so many things to look after. But somebody observed him throughout the campaign, talking about what he was going through each and every day."

**The Record:**
- Daily account
- From Bhau's perspective
- Observer writing it down
- Personal thoughts and experiences

---

## The First Contradictory Letter: "Don't Come"

### From Holkar & Shinde in the Doab

**Their Location:**
> "Raja Sri Malharji Holkar and Jankoji Shinde were in the Antarvedi."

**Antarvedi/Doab:**
> "The same thing as what we call it: Doab. The area between Yamuna and Ganga."

**What They Wrote:**
> "From there they sent letters that: 'Saheb (meaning Bhau), do not come forward.'"

**Why They Said This:**
- "Don't hurry up coming in the Doab"
- "Because situation is not favorable to us"
- "It may be unstable"
- Just speculating about reasons

---

## Their Alternative Proposal

### Send Reinforcements, Not Yourself

**What They Asked:**
> "Send forces to augment our force. Send backup, reinforcements. But don't come yourself - that's what I understand."

**Their Claim:**
> "They are saying if you send us backup, then we ourselves will defeat Abdali's forces in the Doab."

**The Implication:**
> "So you don't have to bring your army across Yamuna River. We will do it for you."

**Their Attitude:**
> "They were just trying to be showing that we are in control and everything is good. We're handling it."

**The Reality:**
> "But that's probably an ego."

---

## The Status Argument

### Why Bhau Shouldn't Come

**Their Reasoning:**
> "If you yourself come into the Doab to fight with Abdali and his forces, then your respect (Ahab) will go down."

**The Logic:**
> "For you to come here it shows that Abdali is your equal rival. But it doesn't dignify the Peshwa or his family member coming."

**What They're Saying:**
- You don't have to come
- We will take care of it
- Should not be giving Abdali too much respect
- Or too much status
- Doesn't deserve Bhau coming to the Doab
- Beneath his dignity

---

## The Second Contradictory Letter: "We Need You!"

### The Complete Opposite

**Now They're Saying:**
> "But [then] we are no longer... [different message]. Or this is some commentary on the letter."

**The Real Assessment:**
> "The Gilche (Afghans) - Afghan army is too strong. And unless both of us get together, unify, we won't be able to defeat them."

**Tolna:**
- Means **to balance**
- Need to balance against them
- Can't match them alone

**The New Narrative:**
> "So this is a kind of the other narrative. They are basically saying, Gilche means Afghan army is too strong. So we have to come together as all factions of the Maratha contingent. Then only we will be able to balance them. And then we can effectively give them befitting reply."

---

## The Contradiction Analysis

### Two Opposite Messages

**Message #1:**
- Don't come yourself
- Send reinforcements
- We got this
- Would lower your status
- We're in control

**Message #2:**
- Afghan army too strong
- Need everyone together
- Can't defeat them alone
- Must unify all factions
- Please come

**The Question:**
- Which one is true?
- Are these from different times?
- Different people?
- Changed assessment?
- "I don't know what exactly is happening here"

## Critical Insights

### 1. The 18th Century Speed Defense

**The Argument:**
- This was normal speed for armies
- Even with one month stop at Dholpur
- On par with historical examples
- Can't criticize for being slow
- That's just how armies moved

**The Implication:**
- Critics are anachronistic
- Expecting modern speeds
- Ignoring historical context
- Bhau wasn't unusually slow

### 2. The Chambar Disaster

**The Small River Problem:**
- Took **8-10 days** to cross
- Ravines on both banks
- Monsoon starting
- Cannons extremely difficult
- Elephants struggling

**The Warning Sign:**
- If small tributary takes 10 days
- How long for Yamuna? (much bigger)
- Foreshadowing the river crossing disaster
- Geography defeating them

### 3. The Confederacy Problem

**The Structure:**
- Multiple independent factions
- Own commanders
- Own territories
- Loose coordination
- Report to Peshwa but have freedom

**The Challenge:**
- Hard to unify command
- Different priorities
- Ego conflicts
- Communication delays
- Not a unified army

### 4. The Contradictory Messages Mystery

**Possibility #1: Ego Then Reality**
- First: proud, think they can handle it
- Then: realize they can't, need help
- Pride before reality check

**Possibility #2: Different Sources**
- Different commanders
- Different assessments
- Not coordinated
- Confusion

**Possibility #3: Deliberate Confusion**
- Trying to keep options open
- Hedging their bets
- Not committing
- Playing politics

**Possibility #4: Time Gap**
- Situation changed between letters
- First: before seeing full Afghan strength
- Second: after engagements, now scared

### 5. The Status Game

**The Argument:**
- If Bhau comes = elevates Abdali
- Makes him equal rival
- Lowers Bhau's dignity
- Should send subordinates

**The Problem With This:**
- Abdali **is** serious threat
- Not acknowledging reality
- Ego over tactics
- Status concerns vs survival

**The Irony:**
- They want reinforcements
- But claim they're winning
- Can't have both
- Contradiction reveals truth

### 6. The Diplomatic Chaos

**Multiple Simultaneous Tracks:**
- Hafiz Rahimat Khan offering reconciliation
- Najib Khan & Jahan Khan besieging Itawa
- Sureshwar Jat being courted by both sides
- No coordinated Afghan strategy?
- Or deliberate confusion tactic?

**The Assessment:**
> "Their actions don't jive. Playing two-faced game. Cannot be trusted."

**The Question:**
- Is this Afghan confusion?
- Or strategic ambiguity?
- Keep opponents guessing?
- Genuine split between commanders?

### 7. The Siege Strategy

**Itawa Under Siege:**
- Cut off Maratha stronghold
- Prevent reinforcements
- Isolate garrison
- Systematic approach

**The Pattern:**
- While offering peace talks
- Also conducting siege warfare
- Talk and fight simultaneously
- Keep all options open

### 8. The Kaifiyat Record

**Why It Matters:**
- Personal perspective
- Day-by-day account
- Bhau's thoughts and experiences
- Primary source for understanding decisions

**The Problem:**
- Written by observer, not Bhau
- How accurate?
- Filtered through someone else
- Possibly self-serving account

### 9. The Monsoon Timing Disaster

**The Math:**
- June 4: at Chambar
- June 4-13: crossing Chambar (10 days)
- June 7: normal monsoon start
- Already too late
- And this is just a small tributary!

**The Implication:**
- If tributary takes 10 days in monsoon
- Yamuna impossible
- Stuck until monsoon ends
- Campaign timeline destroyed

### 10. The Historical Road

**The Route:**
- Same road Shivaji used
- Only main route north-south
- Rough, unpaved
- No alternatives
- Predictable movements

**The Problem:**
- Enemy knows where you're going
- Can't surprise them
- Limited options
- Terrain dictates strategy

---

## The Two Narratives

### Narrative #1: We're Winning

**From Holkar & Shinde:**
- Don't come, send reinforcements
- We got this under control
- Would lower your status to come
- Abdali not that serious
- We're handling it

**The Subtext:**
- Keep credit for ourselves
- Don't want Bhau taking over
- Ego and territory protection
- "We're in control"

---

### Narrative #2: We're Desperate

**Also From Holkar & Shinde:**
- Afghan army too strong
- Need everyone together
- Can't defeat them alone
- Must unify all factions
- Please help us

**The Subtext:**
- Actually scared
- Overwhelmed by Afghan strength
- Need backup desperately
- Reality setting in

---

## Where We Left Off

**The Situation:**
- Bhau crossed Chambar (took 10 days!)
- South of Dholpur, in Jat territory
- Jankoji Shinde joining him (end of June)
- Headed toward Mathura (on Yamuna)
- Holkar and Shinde already in Doab
- Sending contradictory messages
- First: don't come, we got this
- Second: Afghan army too strong, need everyone

**The Questions:**
- Which message is true?
- Are Holkar and Shinde reliable?
- Why the contradiction?
- Can they actually hold Doab without Bhau?
- How long will Yamuna crossing take (if Chambar = 10 days)?
- Is Abdali offering genuine peace talks?
- Or stalling while besieging Itawa?
- Will forces unify properly?
- Or maintain separate commands?

---

*The Chambar crossing took 10 days for a small tributary. The letters from the Doab say two opposite things in the same breath: "Don't come, we're handling it" and "Afghan army too strong, need everyone." One of these is true. One is pride. The monsoon has started. The Yamuna still ahead. And somewhere in the contradiction between those two letters is the truth about how desperate the situation really is.*
