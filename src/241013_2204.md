# Bengal Betrayal & The Battle of Plassey (1745-1756)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Bengal Tragedy: Bhaskar Ram's Massacre

### The Setup

**Bhaskar Ram Kulkarkar** = Brave commander-in-chief serving **Raghuji Bhosle** (Nagpur kingdom)

**His mission:** Bring the Mughal commander **Ali Wardi Khan** (Subedar of Bengal) to heel and make him pay tribute (*chauth*)

### The Trap

**Ali Wardi Khan's plan:**
- Agreed to pay the tribute
- Invited Bhaskar Ram to meet him
- Showed all signs of cooperation

**The betrayal:**
- Once Bhaskar Ram entered Ali Wardi Khan's tent
- On the way to the throne, he was **attacked and killed**
- Maratha warriors adjacent to Bhaskar Ram were also **massacred**

**Year confusion in the text:**
- The massacre likely happened around **1743-1745**
- Exact date not specified in the reading

---

## The Maratha Revenge (1745-1746)

### Swift Retribution

**1745-1746:** Marathas took revenge for the Bhaskar Ram massacre
- Attacked and punished Ali Wardi Khan's forces
- Exacted retribution for the treachery

### The Long Negotiation

**The aftermath:**
- Revenge accomplished in 1745-1746
- BUT truce treaties took much longer to finalize
- **1751:** Final settlement reached
- Took **6 years** to decide:
  - Exact terms of the truce
  - How much tribute would be paid
  - Final peace articles

**Until 1751, the details remained unsettled.**

---

## The Succession Crisis in Nagpur (1755)

### Raghuji Bhosle Dies

**1755:** Raghuji Bhosle (ruler of Nagpur kingdom) died

**The problem:**
- Had **three sons**
- All started claiming their father's estate and kingdom
- Couldn't come to unanimous opinion
- Fighting among themselves over inheritance

### Why This Matters

**The Nagpur Marathas were different:**
- Not as pervasive and ambitious as the Pune Peshwas
- More content with their territory
- Their focus: **Bengal only** (as Shahu had decided - territorial division)
- Not as capable as Nana Saheb Peshwa and his forces

**The resolution:**
- Since the three sons couldn't decide
- The whole affair went to **Nana Saheb Peshwa in Pune**
- He was the ultimate authority for such disputes

---

## Ali Wardi Khan Dies (1756)

### The Capable Leader Lost

**1756:** Ali Wardi Khan himself died
- He was **capable, shrewd, and mature**
- Knew how to navigate politics

### The Immature Successor

**Siraj-ud-Daula** became the new Nawab/Subedar of Bengal
- Described as **"Paripakwamji"** = **immature**
- NOT like his father
- Lacking in capability and shrewdness

**The concern:** An immature leader might do something rash or make poor decisions.

---

## The Battle of Plassey: British Enter the Game (1756)

### The Small Town That Changed Everything

**1756:** War in a small Bengal town called **Plassey**

**The opponents:**
- **British** (led by General Robert Clive)
- **Siraj-ud-Daula** (new Nawab of Bengal)

### The Absurd Numbers

**Military strength comparison:**
- British: **5,000 fighting force**
- Siraj-ud-Daula: **~100,000 soldiers**

**The British won anyway.**

---

## How the British Won Despite Being Outnumbered 20:1

### Factor 1: Immature Commander

**Siraj-ud-Daula's weakness:**
- Young and inexperienced
- Poor military decision-making
- Lacked his father's political acumen

### Factor 2: British Corruption Tactics

**The British playbook:**
- Bribed some of Siraj-ud-Daula's generals
- Paid them to **not participate in battle**
- Generals said: "We're not coming to fight"
- Created division and confusion

**Result:** Sections of Siraj-ud-Daula's massive army simply didn't show up or fight.

---

## The Consequences: Bengal Falls to British

### 1756: British Flag Over Mughal Bengal

**What happened:**
- Bengal went into **British hands**
- First major Indian province under British control
- The beginning of the British Raj

### The Maratha Miscalculation

**Why Marathas didn't pay attention:**
- Perceived British as **"basically merchants with some weapons"**
- Thought: "They just want defense for merchant activities"
- Believed: "That's why they fought this battle"
- **âŒ Didn't realize British had ambitions beyond commerce**

**The fatal error:**
- This was a **BIG DEAL** - entire province falling to foreigners
- But Marathas **did not pay the attention it deserved**
- Underestimated British colonial ambitions
- This blindness would cost them dearly

---

## The European Power Shift

### Bussy vs. The British

**Remember Bussy?** French general who worked with Nizam

**The changing balance:**
- Bussy was previously the **most powerful European** in India
- Helped Nizam with his cannon force
- **But now:** British were getting **more powerful** than Bussy
- British becoming more entrenched, more powerful
- Starting to overtake French influence

**This is just stated as a fact - not discussed whether Marathas/Nizam liked it or not.**

---

## The Nizam Connection to Pune

### Why Hyderabad Mattered

**Geographic reality:**
- Mughal Empire based in **Delhi** (far from Pune)
- But **Hyderabad** had the Nizam
- Nizam = **vassal king representing Mughal Empire**
- Hyderabad was **not too far from Pune**

**The representation:**
- Even though Mughal Emperor was distant
- **Nizam in Hyderabad = Mughal representative**
- Relatively close to Maratha power center
- Mattered for regional politics

---

## The Kolhapur vs. Satara Question

### Who Should Have Dealt with the Nizam?

**The dilemma (unclear in sources):**
- Was it **Shahu's idea** to let Nizam stay in power in Hyderabad?
- OR was it because of **Kolhapur king's inaction**?

**The context:**
- Kolhapur Maratha king should have taken action to finish off the Nizam
- But didn't do it
- Unclear if this was by design (Shahu's plan) or negligence

---

## The Maratha Kingdom Division (1730)

### The Boundary Settlement

**1730:** Clear boundaries drawn between two Maratha kingdoms:

| Kingdom | Ruler | Territory |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Satara** | Shahu Maharaj | Shahu's territory |
| **Kolhapur** | Sambhaji II | Rajaram's son's territory |

**Important clarifications:**
- This Sambhaji = NOT Shivaji's son
- This Sambhaji = Rajaram's son
- Rajaram = interim king after Shivaji's sons

**The relationship:**
- Friendly Maratha kingdoms (not rival)
- Twin kingdoms, clearly delineated
- Boundaries well drawn by 1730

---

## The Expansion Problem

### Sambhaji's Lack of Ambition

**The Kolhapur king (Sambhaji and his heirs):**
- âŒ Not intent on expanding the kingdom
- Content with what they had
- Couldn't be bothered with southern expansion

**The consequence:**
- Responsibility for **southern expansion fell to the Peshwa**
- Only Nana Saheb Peshwa was doing the work
- Kolhapur wasn't pulling its weight

---

## Bajirao's Missed Opportunities with the Nizam

### The Four Defeats

**Historical fact:** Bajirao I defeated the Nizam of Hyderabad **FOUR times**

**But he did NOT vanquish the Nizam's power:**
- Could have finished him off
- Every time he won, he **let the Nizam live**
- Never completely destroyed his capacity to fight

### The Nizam's Persistence

**Despite four defeats:**
- Nizam was **not ready to accept defeat**
- Never became peaceful
- Always considered Peshwa and Marathas as **rivals and enemies**
- Kept wanting to fight back
- Never accepted: "I'm never going to win"
- Thought: "Maybe next time I'll do better"

**The result:** He was a **constant threat** that never went away.

**The connection:** This is the same Nizam whose son (or successor) eventually goes to Delhi and becomes **Imad-ul-Mulk**.

**What could have been prevented:** If Bajirao had finished off the Nizam, the entire Imad-ul-Mulk situation could have been avoided.

---

## The Bussy Threat to Marathas

### Why The French General Mattered

**Bussy:** French general in service of the Nizam

**What made him dangerous:**
- Developed **novel technique with cannon force**
- Long-range cannons (French technology and know-how)
- French fighting techniques
- âŒ Marathas were NOT acquainted with this style
- Marathas had **no answer for it**

**The verdict:** Bussy's cannon regiment = **real reason the Nizam was a threat**

**Normally:** Nizam was beatable
**With Bussy:** Nizam became **deadly** - much more dangerous than usual

---

## Bussy Gets Fired (1756)

### The Falling Out

**1756:** Bussy and Nizam Salabat Jang fell apart
- Bad blood developed between them
- Bushi was **relieved of duty** (fired by the Nizam)

**The mistake:** Firing Bushi was a strategic error for the Nizam.

---

## The Charminar Standoff

### Bushi's Power Play

**Location:** Charminar area in Hyderabad (historic tower, still stands today)

**What Bushi did:**
- Took his **cannon regiment** to the Charminar area
- Set up defensive position
- **Wouldn't leave**

**Why this worked:**
- Cannon regiment was incredibly well-defended
- Loyal to Bushi (not to Nizam)
- They were **his personal followers**
- Some may have been Frenchmen, most were local
- But Bushi **paid their salaries**, trained them, was their boss
- **Loyalty to him > loyalty to Nizam**

**The standoff:**
- Nizam couldn't dislodge him
- Too difficult to attack the cannon regiment
- Bushi basically said: **"Come any closer and I'll blow you to bits"**
- Everyone was **"shit scared"**
- Nobody would come close

**Result:** Bushi got to **stay put** in his fortified position despite being fired.

---

## Why the Peshwas Were Impressed

### The News Reaches Pune

**Who heard about it:**
- **Sadashiv Rao Bhau** (cousin of Nana Saheb Peshwa)
- **Nana Saheb Peshwa** himself

**Why they were impressed:**
- Such a good cannon regiment
- Could keep the Nizam at bay **in his own capital**
- Demonstrated raw power of cannon technology

### The Maratha Realization

**The problem:**
- Maratha power was now projected **to the very north**
- No longer a ragtag army
- Established themselves with Mughals and northern players
- **BUT in the north = no mountains**
  - Can't do *Ganinikawa* (guerrilla warfare)
  - No Sahyadri mountains
  - No mountain forts
  - Had to fight in **open, fertile plains**

**The dilemma:**
- Fighting in open warfare = need an ace up your sleeve
- Without some advantage = 50-50 battle
- Can't leave it to chance

**The solution they saw:**
- **"We need long-range cannons"**
- **"We need a force trained in it"**
- **"This is the ace we need"**
- Otherwise: can't project Maratha power all the way to north
- Otherwise: stuck playing old Shivaji tactics (run to fort when enemy comes)

**The strategic shift:**
- Old way: Retreat to Raigarh, Rajagarh, Simhagarh when threatened
- New reality: In northern plains, there's nowhere to run
- **"You are in front of each other"**
- **Need this cannon regiment - long range and highly disciplined**

**Why Bushi's importance comes in:** He was a Frenchman who trained his guys for months. They were the **best trained cannon force available.**

- **Plassey** - Small town in Bengal (site of battle)
- **Nagpur** - Raghuji Bhosle's kingdom (eastern Marathas)
- **Pune** - Nana Saheb Peshwa's capital
- **Hyderabad** - Nizam's capital (not far from Pune)

---

## Critical Insights

### The Fatal Underestimation

**The Maratha blindspot:**
- Saw British as "merchants with weapons"
- Didn't recognize colonial ambitions
- Thought Plassey was about protecting trade
- **Lost an entire province to foreigners and barely noticed**
- This casual attitude toward European powers = strategic disaster

### The Treachery Pattern

**Bengal betrayal:**
- Show cooperation → invite to tent → massacre
- Classic tactic when facing superior force
- Bribe enemy generals to not fight
- **British learned from local playbook** (bribery at Plassey)

### The Cannon Awakening

**Why Bushi's standoff mattered:**
- Demonstrated raw power of modern artillery
- One man with cannon regiment > entire Nizam army
- **Could hold off a kingdom with technology**
- Marathas realized: "We need this for northern campaigns"
- No mountains = need technological ace

### The Succession Curse

**Power vacuum problems:**
- Raghuji's three sons fighting = weakness
- Immature leaders (Siraj-ud-Daula) = vulnerability
- Lost Bengal because young, inexperienced nawab
- Pattern will repeat (leadership transitions = crisis)

### Bajirao's Mercy = Future Problems

**The four victories wasted:**
- Defeated Nizam four times
- Let him live every time
- **Nizam never accepted defeat**
- Constant threat that festered
- Eventually his lineage (Imad-ul-Mulk) causes major problems
- **Mercy toward enemies = strategic error**

### The Northern Plain Problem

**Geographic determinism:**
- Shivaji's tactics = mountain-based guerrilla warfare
- North India = flat plains, no mountains
- Old tactics don't work
- **Need to adapt or die**
- Cannons = answer to geographic disadvantage
- But cultural resistance to new warfare styles

---

*1756 was a watershed year: Bengal fell to the British while the Marathas barely noticed, the Nizam fired his best general who then held an entire city hostage with cannon power, and the Peshwas finally understood they needed to completely reinvent Maratha warfare for the northern plains. The age of guerrilla tactics was over. The age of artillery had begun. But were they adapting fast enough?*
