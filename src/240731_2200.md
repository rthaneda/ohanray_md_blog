# The Creation of the Peshwa Position: Balaji Vishwanath's Rise (1713-1714)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Shahu's Weakness & The Crisis

**The Problem:**
- Shahu was released into Maratha sovereignty with no skills
- No military training, no administrative ability, no statecraft knowledge
- Dependent personality type—never allowed to develop competence
- By early 1710s, things were falling apart around him

**The Events Showing Decline:**
- Chandrasen Jadav (military commander) left Shahu's service
- Went to Tara Rani initially, then to Nizam of Hyderabad
- Shahu's Peshwa (Prime Minister) was imprisoned by Kanhoji Angre
- Kanhoji had defeated Shahu's forces and held the PM prisoner
- Everything pointing to Shahu's quick decline and failure

**The Factional Battle:**
- Not open warfare but political skirmishing between Shahu and Tara Rani
- Personality conflicts, rivalry, bickering
- Minor confrontations but no all-out war
- Kanhoji Angre worked for Tara Rani, imprisoned Shahu's PM

**The Situation:**
- Shahu had no fighting skills like his grandfather or father
- Didn't know how to go on campaigns or lead battles
- Lacked basic management and administration skills
- His rule was going downhill rapidly

## Enter Balaji Vishwanath

**His Background:**
- Originally from Pokhara (coast area)
- Worked in revenue department under Siddhi of Janjira
- Entered Maratha employment around 1699 or earlier
- Had been in service even before Shahu was released (under Tara Rani)
- Worked alongside Dhanaji Jatho

**His Rise:**
- When Shahu was anointed as Chhatrapati (sovereign) at Satara, Dhanaji Jatho died
- Dhanaji's son became commander-in-chief under Shahu
- Balaji Vishwanath remained in court but in administrative role
- Had already created good impression on Shahu by this point

**His Position Before:**
- Not yet Peshwa/Prime Minister
- Significant personality in court but supporting role
- Had gained Shahu's trust through competence and ability
- But hadn't yet risen to supreme position

---

## The Kanhoji Angre Problem

**Who He Was:**
- Powerful commander, originally in Tara Rani's service
- Based in Kokan (coastal region)
- Had defeated Shahu's forces in battle
- Imprisoned Shahu's Peshwa (Prime Minister) in Kolhapur
- Creating major problem for Shahu's authority

**His Background:**
- Father was Tukoji Angre, served under Shivaji (founder)
- Had inherited position and loyalty to Shivaji's legacy
- But was working for Tara Rani, rival to Shahu
- May have broken with Tara Rani after imprisoning Shahu's PM

**Why He Mattered:**
- Controlled significant coastal forces and forts
- Was powerful enough to defeat Shahu militarily
- His loyalty could swing power balance either way
- His support would legitimize Shahu's rule

---

## The Strategic Masterstroke

**Shahu's Insight:**
- Realized he needed someone who was both statesman AND warrior
- Most Peshwas before were just warriors/administrators
- But Shahu needed something rare: diplomat who could fight

**The Key Decision:**
- Selected Balaji Vishwanath (a Brahmin) as Peshwa
- Revolutionary: Breaking tradition of warrior-class Peshwas
- Shivaji had a Peshwa, but position was minor
- Shahu's Peshwa would be almost "acting CEO" due to his incompetence

**Why a Brahmin?**
- Brahmins typically did diplomacy and administration
- Marathas typically did fighting (warrior class, Kshatriya)
- Balaji had rare combination: diplomatic smarts + fighting ability
- Path-breaking decision—first time such appointment

**The Negotiation:**
- Shahu assigned Balaji task: "Turn Kanhoji Angre to our side"
- Balaji immediately countered: "I can't do that as regular courtier"
- "Give me important position—make me Peshwa"
- Shahu agreed—**November 17, 1713: Balaji Vishwanath became first Peshwa**

## The Famous Letter: Balaji's Diplomatic Masterpiece

**The Setup:**
- Balaji took 10,000 troops to Kokan (where Kanhoji was based)
- Rather than fight immediately, he wrote a letter
- Letter shows both statesmanship and threat

**The Message:**
1. **Appeal to Loyalty:** "Your father Tukoji served Shivaji, our founder. This is beneath you."

2. **The Choice (Diplomatic):** 
   - Option 1: Go back to Tara Rani, release our PM, serve her
   - Option 2: Join Shahu, release PM, get employment with us

3. **The Ultimatum (Threat):**
   - Option 3: Prepare for battle with me
   - I will take all your forts and defeat you
   - Once battle starts, if you lose and try to make amends, too late
   - "Concede now or never"

**The Brilliance:**
- Not aggressive—offers way out with dignity
- Appeals to family honor (father's service to Shivaji)
- Gives him choices rather than demands
- Combines diplomacy with clear military threat
- Shows he understood Kanhoji personally

**The Tone:**
- Professional, respectful, but firm
- Not arrogant but confident
- Gives face-saving exit for Kanhoji
- Balaji's brains on full display

---

## The Resolution

**The Meeting (February 18, 1714):**
- Balaji and Kanhoji met at Lohagad fort
- Made a deal without fighting
- Truce established between them
- Kanhoji agreed to join Shahu's side

**The Approval:**
- Shahu had to give his formal approval ("stamp of approval")
- Shahu's role as sovereign still ceremonial but real
- Shows Balaji understood chain of command

**The Outcome:**
- Kanhoji Angre brought his forces to Shahu
- Shahu's position stabilized immediately
- Balaji proved his worth as Peshwa
- Established pattern of diplomatic-military leadership

## The Significance of This Moment

**Why This Was Pivotal:**

### 1. The Peshwa Institution Born
First time Peshwa position held real power because sovereign was incompetent. Created template for hereditary Peshwa rule that lasted decades.

### 2. Brahmin-Warrior Combination
Balaji showed Brahmin could fight and lead, not just advise. Broke caste-occupation rigidity. Created space for administrative class to hold military power.

### 3. Diplomatic-Military Balance
Balaji's letter shows winning without unnecessary war. Uses threat as tool, not first resort. Sets tone for future Maratha expansion: smart + strong.

### 4. Shahu's Judgment
Despite incompetence in other areas, Shahu showed genius in recognizing what he needed and picking the right person. Trusted Balaji with immense responsibility immediately.

### 5. Institutional Legitimacy
Rather than seizing power, Balaji was appointed by Shahu. This gave him legitimacy that would sustain his family for generations. Not a usurper but chosen administrator.

---

## The Rare Combination

**What Balaji Had:**
- Revenue/administrative background (Brahmin training)
- Military fighting ability (rare for Brahmins)
- Diplomatic skill (shown in letter)
- Strategic thinking (offered choices rather than ultimatums alone)
- Loyalty to Shahu (despite being more capable)

**Why This Mattered:**
- Most military leaders: just fight, no diplomacy
- Most administrators: no combat ability
- Balaji: both competent at war AND politics
- This made him invaluable to weak sovereign

## Critical Insights

### 1. Competence as Legitimacy
Shahu chose Balaji not for birth but for competence. In moment of crisis, legitimacy comes from ability to deliver, not title alone.

### 2. The Power of One Good Decision
Single appointment of right person (Balaji) turned Shahu's declining position into stable rule. One decision created trajectory for next 50 years.

### 3. Diplomacy Over Force
Balaji's letter prevented unnecessary war. Force was backup, not first option. Saved lives, resources, soldiers. Shows strategic wisdom.

### 4. Institutional vs. Personal Power
Balaji didn't take power—was given it. This made succession possible later. Personal power dies with person; institutional power can transfer.

### 5. The Rare Combination Needed
Cannot solve complex problems with just brains or just strength. Need rare individuals with both. That's why Balaji was invaluable.

## The Letter's Genius Breakdown

**Components of Effective Leadership in Letter:**

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Appeal to legacy | Gives honorable exit |
| Options offered | Shows respect for choice |
| Clear consequences | No ambiguity about stakes |
| Military backup | Makes threat credible |

## Character of Balaji Vishwanath

**Strengths Shown:**
- Political acumen (understood Kanhoji's pride)
- Military confidence (10,000 troops backup)
- Diplomatic skill (letter tone and content)
- Organizational ability (coordinated campaign)
- Loyalty (worked for weak Shahu despite being able to take power)

**Why He Didn't Become King:**
- Despite power, chose to remain subordinate to Shahu
- Understood institutional legitimacy matters
- Established precedent: Peshwa serves sovereign
- This restraint gave his family legitimacy that personal rule wouldn't have

---

## The Shahu-Balaji Dynamic

**Why It Worked:**
- Shahu recognized his limits and hired solution
- Balaji respected Shahu's sovereign position despite inferiority
- Perfect balance: weak sovereign, strong PM
- Mutual benefit: Shahu kept legitimacy, Balaji got power

**Why It Couldn't Happen Today:**
- Today's Balaji would just take power
- Shahu would demand PM title too
- Institutional legitimacy gone
- Personal ambition replaces duty to office

---

**Where We Left Off:** Balaji Vishwanath has successfully stabilized Shahu's rule by bringing Kanhoji Angre to his side. The Peshwa institution is born. Balaji proved that brains + muscle + diplomacy can solve impossible situations. He's set the stage for Maratha expansion. From here, Maratha power will grow exponentially—but it'll depend entirely on having competent Peshwas. The institution he created will matter more than any individual.

---

*Shahu was hopeless. No skills, no training, no ability. Tara Rani was fighting him, Kanhoji was imprisoning his ministers, everything was falling apart. But Shahu had one moment of genius: he recognized exactly what he needed and picked exactly the right person. Not a warrior, because he had plenty of those. A statesman-warrior. A man with brains and muscle. A man who could see that Kanhoji Angre was trapped between honor to a founder and employment by a rival, and could offer him a way out that saved face. Balaji wrote a letter instead of drawing a sword. And it worked. In that single letter, you see the entire future of Maratha power: smart force. Not brute force, not cunning alone—both together. That's what made them different. That's what made them dangerous.*
