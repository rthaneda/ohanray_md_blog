# The Battle of Palkhed: Bajirao's Masterclass in Strategy (March 1728)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Setup: Two Powers Collide

**The Situation (1727-1728):**
- **Nizam of Hyderabad** claiming superiority over Marathas
- Nizam has **cannon division** (major military advantage)
- Nizam in Pune with his army, harassing villages
- Marathas cannot fight him because of cannons
- Nizam is an autonomous power despite nominal Mughal service

**The Problem for Bajirao:**
- As long as Nizam has cannons = Marathas vulnerable
- Cannot engage in direct battle
- Cannon division prevents cavalry tactics
- Speed and agility = Bajirao's advantage, nullified by cannons

---

## Nizam of Hyderabad: The Background

**Who He Was:**
- Originally **Subedar (governor) for Mughals** in south
- Declared autonomy from Mughal Emperor
- Moved to Hyderabad and established own kingdom
- Now **semi-independent, semi-Mughal** representative

**Why He's a Problem:**
- Claiming that **Kolhapur branch is true Shivaji heir**
- Saying Shahu is "fake"
- Trying to undermine Shahu's legitimacy
- Supporting Shahu's rivals for political advantage

**His Military Strength:**
- Cannon division (trained regiment)
- Large army
- Fortified positions
- Resources of semi-autonomous kingdom

---

## Bajirao's Dilemma & Strategy

**The Cannon Problem:**
> "As long as Mr. Nizam had the cannon division with him, Bajirao couldn't dare to come any close to Nizam. He could really chew him out."

**Bajirao's Insight:**
- Must find a way to **separate Nizam from his cannons**
- Cannons are heavy, require elephants/horses to move
- Cannot move quickly
- Bajirao moves **lightning fast**

**The Strategy:**
1. Force Nizam to abandon the cannon division
2. Make cannons seem like a liability
3. Pursue Nizam so aggressively he must leave them behind
4. Then fight cannon-free battle

---

## The Aggressive Response: Raiding Nizam Territory

**Bajirao's Tactic:**
> "His technique was if you are in my area, then I will go to your area"

**The Execution:**
- Went into Nizam territory
- Started raiding villages
- Defeated one of Nizam's commanders in battle
- Created chaos in Nizam-held areas

**Geographic Moves:**
- Went south and east toward Jalna
- Hit areas like Sindakhe (Nizam territory)
- Moved northwest toward Gujarat border
- Destroyed settlements, fought skirmishes

**The Advantage:**
- Could move "lightning moves" with cavalry only
- No heavy cannons to slow him down
- Kept appearing where not expected
- Made Nizam increasingly worried

---

## The Psychological Pressure

**Nizam's Growing Worry:**
- Shahu and Bajirao's brother Chimaji on high ground at Purandar
- Shahu protected from cannon attack
- But villages around Pune vulnerable
- Now Bajirao creating havoc in Nizam's own territory

**The Bind:**
- If he stays in Pune: loses control of his areas
- If he pursues Bajirao: leaves Pune exposed
- Cannons are liability (too slow)
- Can't fight cavalry with cannons alone

---

## The Rumor That Changed Everything

**Creating Doubt:**
- Bajirao spreads rumor that **he's going to attack Burhanpur**
- Burhanpur was old **Mughal gateway to Deccan**
- Relatively wealthy and lightly defended
- Prestigious Mughal station

**Why This Broke Nizam:**
- If Marathas raid Burhanpur = **Mughal prestige at stake**
- Mughals would demand response
- Nizam, as Mughal representative, would be blamed
- **Must engage Bajirao in battle**

**The Genius:**
- Not really going to Burhanpur (just rumor)
- Forces Nizam into open field battle
- Makes him abandon cannons if he wants to move fast

---

## The Fatal Decision: Cannons Left Behind

**Nizam's Dilemma:**
> "He had a dilemma. If he were to carry his cannon regiment... these guys were expert in cannon fighting. They cannot move quickly. These cannons are heavy."

**The Choice:**
- Cannon regiment can travel with horses/elephants
- But too slow for pursuit
- Bajirao moves "lightning speed"
- If he carries cannons, Bajirao escapes
- If he leaves cannons, no fire advantage

**Nizam's Decision:**
- Left cannon division in Pune
- Took smaller force with him
- Could move faster
- Pursued Bajirao with cavalry/infantry only

---

## The Battle of Palkhed: Setting the Trap

**The Location:**
- Town called Palkhed near Rangabad area
- Strategic positioning for Bajirao

**Bajirao's Trap:**
- Surrounded Nizam in critical directions
- Blocked major roads
- River nearby = water source controlled
- Cut off supplies and water

**The Encirclement:**
> "Surrounded meaning it's not like every direction Bajirao was around him, but in critical directions Bajirao's forces were there"

- Not completely surrounded
- But major escape routes blocked
- Cannot get to water stream
- Food and water cut off

**The Desperation:**
- Without water = death sentence in battle conditions
- Horses cannot drink = animals dying
- Men getting desperate
- Survival measured in hours/days

---

## The Negotiation: Water for Hostages

**The Crisis:**
- Nizam's army trapped
- No water access
- Soldiers starting to suffer
- Commanders realize they're trapped

**The Mercy Petition:**
- Nizam's commanders approached Bajirao
- Begged for their leader's life
- Desperate situation

**Bajirao's Terms:**
> "If you want to get the water source, then keep some hostages with me. I will allow you to access the water source."

**The Hostage Exchange:**
- Approximately **300 people taken as hostages**
- Nizam allowed access to river water
- Army got access to vital resource
- But at terrible price

---

## The Treaty of Palkhed: The Terms

**What Nizam Had to Accept:**

**1. Kolhapur Boundaries:**
- Kolhapur branch **cannot cross Krishna river north**
- Cannot expand toward northern territories
- Permanently sidelined
- Maratha unity confirmed under Shahu

**2. Territorial Concession:**
- Southern provinces previously held by Mughals directly
- Were granted to Marathas
- Nizam acknowledged these were Maratha territories now
- Expansion of Maratha-controlled areas

**3. Sanada Confirmation:**
- Imperial order from Delhi (Sanada) confirming **six provinces**
- Chautai and Sardeshmukhi rights
- Nizam now officially accepts this
- No longer disputes Maratha territorial rights

---

## The Significance: More Than a Battle

**Why It Mattered:**
- Settled the Kolhapur question definitively
- Removed Nizam's claims about succession
- Confirmed Maratha Chautai/Sardeshmukhi rights
- Nizam accepted Mughal imperial orders
- No longer challenges Maratha authority

**The Diplomatic Win:**
> "Because Nizam he even though he had his autonomous Kingdom in Hyderabad, he still was kind of a representative of the Mughal Empire"

- Nizam was semi-independent BUT still Mughal representative
- His acceptance legitimized Maratha position
- Mughal Emperor's orders now binding
- Maratha position strengthened in Mughal politics

**The Strategic Outcome:**
- Bajirao forced opponent to abandon best advantage (cannons)
- Achieved victory without heavy artillery
- Did it through **strategy and psychology**
- Not through brute force but brilliant maneuvering

## Major Themes

### 1. Strategy Over Strength
Nizam had stronger military hardware (cannons). Bajirao won through superior strategy. He forced the opponent into a position where his greatest advantage became irrelevant. Classic strategic thinking.

### 2. Psychology in Warfare
The rumor about Burhanpur wasn't a direct military tactic—it was psychological. It forced Nizam into a decision. Bajirao understood that battles are won in the mind before they're fought with weapons.

### 3. The Cavalry Advantage
Bajirao's entire strategy relied on speed. He couldn't match Nizam's cannons, so he created conditions where speed mattered more than firepower. He changed the game instead of playing the same game.

### 4. Resource Denial as Weapon
Water isn't typically thought of as a weapon, but Bajirao understood it was. He didn't kill Nizam's army directly—he cut off water and let desperation break their will to fight. Elegant and economical.

### 5. Legitimacy Through Victory
The victory wasn't just military. It forced Nizam to accept political terms. The Sanada (imperial order) rights were confirmed. Shahu's legitimacy was established. Kolhapur was definitively sidelined. Politics and military strategy intertwined.

## Critical Insights

### The Cannon Handicap Becomes an Advantage
Nizam thought his cannons were an advantage. Bajirao understood they were actually a liability in the situation. He designed the campaign to make the cannons irrelevant. Classic judo move—use the opponent's strength against them.

### The Rumor Strategy
Most military history focuses on direct tactics. But Bajirao's rumor about Burhanpur was pure strategy. It wasn't meant to be true. It was meant to force a decision. This shows how sophisticated military thinking was, beyond just battles.

### The Water Siege
Modern military thinks in terms of attrition warfare, supply lines, logistics. Bajirao was doing this in 1728. He understood that an army marches on supplies and water. Control those, and the army collapses without a shot fired. The hostage exchange was elegant—he gets guarantees while maintaining control.

### The Political Calculation
The battle wasn't really about defeating Nizam. It was about confirming Shahu's legitimacy, settling the Kolhapur question, and getting Nizam (as Mughal representative) to accept imperial orders. The military victory enabled the political victory.

### Why Bajirao Succeeded Where Others Failed
Shinde and Holkar were good tacticians but lacked strategy. They would have fought Nizam head-on and gotten slaughtered by cannons. Bajirao understood the entire situation—psychological, geographic, political. He designed a campaign that forced Nizam into a losing position before any direct battle.

## Montgomery's Assessment
British historian Montgomery apparently wrote about this campaign as a model of strategic warfare. Even centuries later, military strategists recognize Bajirao's brilliance here.

---

**Where We Left Off:** Palkhed is a complete victory for Bajirao. More than that, it settles major political questions. Shahu's legitimacy is confirmed. Maratha rights to six provinces are validated by Nizam's acceptance. Kolhapur is permanently relegated to minor status. Bajirao's strategy proved that superior military hardware (cannons) can be neutralized by superior thinking. And most importantly, Marathas have now beaten not just a local rival, but a quasi-Mughal power. They're no longer just south Indian kingdom anymore. They're a major continental force.

---

*Nizam arrived in Pune with cannons, confident in his superiority. Bajirao didn't have the heavy artillery to match them. So he didn't try. Instead, he made the cannons a liability. He created situations where speed mattered more than firepower. He denied water to an army surrounded in critical directions. He forced the leader into a desperate choice: abandon his best advantage or abandon his army. When Nizam chose to pursue with cavalry only, he'd already lost. The rumor about Burhanpur wasn't even true—it was just the psychological pressure needed to make him move into the trap. And when it was over, Nizam didn't just lose a battle. He accepted treaties that confirmed Shahu's legitimacy, validated Maratha territorial rights, and permanently sidelined his own potential rival (Kolhapur). Bajirao won everything without even using his strongest asset: his cavalry's speed. He won by thinking better. That's why Montgomery wrote about it as a masterclass.*
