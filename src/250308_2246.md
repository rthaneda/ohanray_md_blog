## The Artillery Arsenal: Diverse and Mobile

### Jamburak Guns: The Heavy Mobile Artillery

**The Design:**
- Large diameter guns (bigger than standard)
- Camel-mounted weapons
- Two soldiers per camel
- Facing opposite directions (180°)
- Mobile while mounted on camel

**The Quantity:**
- 4,000 Jamburak guns total

- Logistical challenge for movement
- Constant repositioning possible

**The Advantage:**

- Lighter than ground-mounted cannons
- More flexible positioning
- Afghan military specialty

### Fixed Cannons: Limited Range

**The Limitation:**
- Fixed cannons present
- Short range (~500 meters or less)
- Can't hit Marathas without being hit
- Dependent on position
- Less effective at distance

**The Implication:**
- Can't engage French artillery (2 km range)
- Must wait for Marathas to approach
- Must rely on mobile artillery
- Defensive positioning necessary
- Range disadvantage critical

### The Horse Superiority

**Indian vs. Durani Horses:**
- Indian breed: smaller stature
- Indian breed: shorter distance capability
- Durani breed: larger and stronger
- Durani breed: can travel farther daily
- Different genetics from different environments

**The Trade-offs:**
- Indian horses: more fuel-efficient
- Indian horses: adapted to heat
- Durani horses: stronger for combat

- Competent but not elite

**The Hierarchy:**
- Abdali's slaves = elite guards
- Abdali's cavalry = professional soldiers
- Allied cavalry = experienced warriors
- Allied foot soldiers = trained infantry

## The Logistical Reality

### The Numbers and Sustainability

**The Force:**
- 80,000 committed fighters minimum
- 20,000-50,000 reserve fighters
- 100,000+ total personnel with support
- 2,000+ camels

**The Supply Needs:**
- Food for 100,000+ people
- Food for 30,000+ animals
- Fodder for horses/camels
- Water for all
- Ammunition and powder

**The Challenge:**
- Traveling from Afghanistan
- Dependent on supplies from Doab
- Can't manufacture locally
- Must sustain in hostile territory
- Limited local support (Muslim population only helps so much)

## The Comparative Assessment

### Against Maratha Forces

**Abdali's Advantages:**
- More cavalry (28,800 vs. Maratha equiv.)

- Shorter cannon range
- Mobile artillery less effective at distance
- Away from home territory
- Supply line stretched

**The Overall:**
- 80,000 vs. 70,000+ (slight advantage)
- But quality advantages offset some numbers
- Composition more experienced
- Better physical conditioning
- More cohesive command

## Kashi Ram's Documentary Value

### What He Provides

**The Evidence:**
- Direct observation of forces
- Named commanders documented
- Specific troop counts
- Weapon descriptions
- Organizational structure

**The Reliability:**
- Professional observer
- Bilingual capability
- Access to all camps
- Trained documentation
- 19 years later written (reflection time)

**The Significance:**
- Only detailed breakdown we have
- Only observer in all three camps
- Validates historical estimates
- Provides specific numbers
- Creates baseline for comparison

---

**Where This Leads:** Kashi Ram's documentation gives us precise numbers: Abdali with 80,000+ fighters of high quality, superior horses from Afghanistan, deep command structure, and diverse weaponry. The Afghan forces are professional, experienced, and equipped with both traditional and newer weapons. The Durani heritage means superior physiology and horses. But the 2 km range disadvantage vs. Maratha artillery is critical. Abdali knows he can't win a long-range artillery duel. He must close to close combat where his experience, numbers, and warrior culture give advantage.

*Kashi Ram counted every soldier. 28,800 cavalry in core force alone. Six battalions as personal guards—that's 7,200 men whose only job was keeping Abdali alive. Four thousand Jamburak guns on camels—mobile firepower moving with the army. Durani horses bigger and stronger than anything in India. Eighty thousand fighters total. He wrote the numbers down. And he knew what they meant. Abdali wasn't just invading. He was bringing a professional, experienced, well-equipped military machine. Not a horde. A disciplined force.*
