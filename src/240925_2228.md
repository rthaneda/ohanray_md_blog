# The Cannon Force & Maratha Northern Expansion (1752-1753)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Historical Background: The Nizam Situation

### Quick Recap (1752)

**October 1752:** Murder of Ghazi-ud-Din in Hyderabad
- He was supposed to be the new Nizam (handpicked by Marathas)
- Got poisoned/killed
- Situation became explosive and complex
- Marathas turned their attention to **Aurangabad**

---

## Why Aurangabad Matters

### The Deccan Power Structure

**Geographic context:**
- **Hyderabad** = Nizam's capital (base of operations)
- **Aurangabad** = Former Mughal capital of the Deccan region
- Still under Nizam's control despite Hyderabad being the main base

**The Nizam's dual role:**
- Semi-independent ruler
- Based in Hyderabad
- Still maintained control over Aurangabad (old Mughal capital)
- **De facto all-in-one ruler/subedar** of the Deccan
- There was no other Mughal subedar in the Deccan besides the Nizam

**Why Marathas targeted it:** After Ghazi-ud-Din's death, Aurangabad was the Nizam's key strategic territory to attack.

## The Battle of Balki: French Cannons Enter the Stage

### The Opponents

**Team Nizam:**
- **Salabat Jang** (the new Nizam, after Ghazi-ud-Din's death)
- **Bussy** (French general) - Chief of the cannon regiment

**Team Maratha:**
- Maratha forces
- **Sadashiv Rao Bhau** was impressed by the performance

### The Outcome

**Marathas won** and received territorial concessions:
- **Nasik city**
- **Trimbak Fort** (Trimbakeshwar)
- Territory between Tapi and Godavari rivers

---

## The French Cannon Technology

### Why This Was Revolutionary

**Bussy** = French general employed by the Nizam

**What made the cannon force special:**
- **Long-range cannons** - could project cannonballs 1.5 to 2 kilometers away
- Required special training (French expertise)
- Highly skilled operation
- Technology developed by the French
- NOT available to every rival in North India (very expensive, needed right contacts)

### Sadashiv Rao's Crucial Observation

Even though Bussy and the Nizam's combined forces were **defeated** by the Marathas, **Sadashiv Rao Bhau was deeply impressed** by the cannon regiment's performance.

**Why this mattered:**
- In the Deccan, Marathas could use guerrilla warfare in the mountains (Sahyadri)
- In **North India = flat plains** → Can't use mountain tactics
- On flat land, battles become **50-50 chances** (Kautilya's warning: never fight such battles!)
- **Solution:** Long-range cannons could be the "ace" that tips the scales

> **Kautilya's principle:** If you fight a battle where your chances are 50-50, never fight it. The risks are too high - you could lose everything.

**Sadashiv Rao's logic:**
- "If I'm going to fight in the north on flat land against a very strong enemy like Abdali..."
- "I MUST have a cannon force with 1.5-2 kilometer range"
- "This is the only way to avoid a 50-50 battle"

---

## The Cannon Force Switches Sides

### Round 2: Nizam vs. Marathas (A Couple Years Later)

**Setup:**
- Another battle between Sadashiv Rao Bhau (Marathas) vs. Nizam
- This time, **Bussy's student** (trained by Bussy) is leading the Nizam's cannon force
- Nizam defeated again

### The Recruitment

After the second defeat, **Sadashiv Rao Bhau made a request:**
- "I want that cannon regiment general to join MY force"
- Nizam agreed (had no objection)

**What transferred over:**
- The cannon force chief (Bussy's student, possibly named **Ibrahim Khan Gardi**)
- **The ENTIRE cannon regiment** came with him

### The Strategy: Buy Don't Build

**The shortcut:**
- Instead of teaching Marathas this skill from scratch
- Instead of raising and training a regiment within the Maratha army
- **Just get the general and the entire trained regiment**
- "Why waste time teaching our people when this guy already has experts?"

**Seemed like a brilliant plan at the time.**

---

## The Mercenary Problem

### Ibrahim Khan Gardi's Loyalty (or Lack Thereof)

**Key issue:** This general (still trained by Bussy) was a **soldier for hire**.

**His mentality:**
- Loyalty was NOT to any particular fighting force
- Would go with **whoever paid more**
- Didn't care if fighting for Marathas, Nizam, Mughals, or anyone else
- No investment in the mission beyond payment

**The red flag:** "That was not a good thing" - his mercenary nature would become a problem later.

## The Emperor's Promise & The Beginning of Major Campaigns

### The One Crore Rupee Deal

**The arrangement:**
- Emperor promised **1 crore rupees** (10 million) to the Maratha army in the north
- Purpose: To fight against Safdar Jang
- Around **mid-1753**

**What actually happened:**
- By the time Raghunath Rao, Holkar, and Shinde reached Delhi (takes 2-3 months travel with army)
- Safdar Jang had already been defeated
- He went back to Awadh (his home kingdom)
- So they didn't have to fight that battle

**But they reached Delhi anyway** - and this changed everything.

---

## The Escalation: From Defense to Offense

### Before: Small Defensive Force

**Previous Maratha presence in Delhi:**
- 3,000-5,000 soldiers
- Under command of **Antaji Mankeshwar**
- Mainly a **defensive force**
- Small scale operations

### After: Major Military Power

**New arrivals:**
- **Raghunath Rao Peshwa** (brother of Nana Saheb)
- **Malhar Rao Holkar**
- **Jayapa Shinde**
- Probably **30,000 soldiers** with them

**This was the beginning of major Maratha campaigns in the north** - now they had enough forces for **aggressive offensive actions**, not just defensive ones.

---

## The Power of Sovereign Authority

### Why Raghunath Rao Changed Everything

**Before Raghunath Rao arrived:**
- Jayapa Shinde and Holkar = just commanders
- âŒ No sovereign authority
- Limited in what decisions they could make

**After Raghunath Rao arrived:**
- ✅ He was the **sovereign's brother** (Nana Saheb's brother)
- ✅ His word carried weight
- ✅ Could take major decisions
- ✅ Could make sweeping strategic calls

**The difference:** He wasn't just another fighter - he was royalty, so:
- Maratha forces felt **empowered**
- Big decisions could be made on the spot
- **Semblance of sovereignty** joined the northern forces

---

## The Long Game: 1753-1761 and Beyond

### A Permanent Northern Presence

**The campaigns that began in 1753:**
- Would continue all the way to **1761** (Panipat)
- Even **beyond that**
- 4-5 decades total
- Marathas were now a **permanent part of North India**
- They would be **stationed there** for the long term

**This wasn't a temporary excursion - this was empire building.**

---

## Historical Context: Qutub Minar & The Dynasties

### Sidebar: Architectural Heritage

**Qutub Minar:** Very tall tower (minar = pillar/spire)
- Dates back to 13th-14th century
- Seen in Delhi
- Hyderabad has its own Qutub Minar too

**Note:** This is NOT related to Qutub Shah (who ruled during Shivaji's time and was destroyed by Aurangzeb).

### The Dynasties Aurangzeb Destroyed

**Three kingdoms Aurangzeb wiped out:**
1. **Nizam Shahi** (Ahmednagar) - destroyed by Shah Jahan
   - Had Malik Ambar as prime minister/wazir
   - Based in Maharashtra (Ahmednagar)
2. **Adil Shahi** (Bijapur) - destroyed by Aurangzeb
3. **Qutub Shahi** (Hyderabad) - destroyed by Aurangzeb

**Important:** The current **Nizam** (Salabat Jang and his lineage) has NOTHING to do with the old Nizam Shahi kingdom. He came from Persia (Iran) originally. Totally different dynasty.

## Critical Insights

### The Cannon Force Gamble

**Smart decision:**
- Recognized the importance of long-range cannon technology
- Understood that flat land warfare required different tactics
- Outsourced rather than built from scratch - faster

**Potential problems:**
- Mercenary loyalty = unreliable
- Not integrated into Maratha army culture
- "Soldier for hire" mentality could backfire

### The Flat Land Problem

**Why cannons became essential:**
- Marathas built their empire on **guerrilla warfare** in mountains
- Shivaji's whole strategy: never fight on flat land, use terrain advantage
- **North India = NO mountains** = forced to adapt
- Cannons were the solution to the 50-50 battle problem

### Sovereign Authority Matters

**The Raghunath Rao effect:**
- Commanders need authority to make big decisions
- Having the Peshwa's brother = instant legitimacy
- Could mediate between rival commanders (Holkar vs. Shinde)
- Empowered the entire force

### From Visitors to Rulers

**The shift:**
- 3,000-5,000 defensive troops → 30,000+ offensive army
- Temporary presence → permanent occupation
- Reactive defense → proactive expansion
- This was no longer about protecting the Mughal emperor
- **This was about Maratha empire building**

*The Marathas got the cannon technology they needed to compete in the north. But they also got a mercenary force whose loyalty was only as deep as their pockets. Meanwhile, with 30,000 troops and the Peshwa's brother leading them, the Marathas weren't just defending Delhi anymore - they were claiming North India as their own.*
