# The Siege of Kumbher Fort (1754)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Setup

The Marathas (led by **Raghunath Rao Peshwa**, **Malhar Rao Holkar**, and **Jayapa Shinde**) are called to Delhi to help the Mughal Emperor fight against Safdarjung and Surajmal Jat. By the time they arrive, that conflict is over, but the Emperor gives them tax collection rights to **Agra and Ajmer provinces**.

**Problem:** Surajmal Jat controls the fort of Kumbher in that territory, and Imad-ul-Mulk (the wazir) is pissed at him, so he tells the Marathas to attack Kumbher fort.

---

## The Negotiations Fail

**January 20, 1754** - Marathas arrive at Kumbher fort.

First, **Khande Rao** (Malhar Rao Holkar's son) arrives early and embarrasses himself at the Mughal court by not knowing proper etiquette:
- Gives only 2 salutes instead of 4
- Forgets tribute entirely
- A courtier has to cover for him with gold coins
- Despite being told to leave, Khande Rao says "nah, I'm staying" which makes everyone nervous

### The Money Dispute

Surajmal fortifies the fort and starts negotiations with Raghunath Rao:

| Party | Offer/Demand |
|-------|--------------|
| **Surajmal offers** | 4 million rupees |
| **Raghunath Rao demands** | 10 million rupees (1 crore) |
| **Surajmal's response** | Sends bullets back: "I'm ready for war" |

---

## The Political Conspiracy

### The Layers of Intrigue

- **Imad-ul-Mulk** publicly asks Marathas to attack Surajmal
- **The Emperor** secretly hopes Marathas succeed (wants Surajmal weakened)
- **BUT** the Emperor also refuses to give Marathas long-range cannons when they ask
- **Surajmal** writes to the Emperor: "Hey, all us northern powers should band together and kick the Marathas back to the Deccan"

### Why Nobody Wants Marathas in the North

**Northern powers include:**
- Mughals
- Awadh
- Rohillas
- Surajmal Jat
- Madho Singh (Rajasthan)

**Their concerns:**
- All worried Marathas will replace the Mughal emperor as the real power
- Marathas are seen as "Deccan-based" power (Peshwa's capital is Pune)
- Nobody wanted to trade one overlord for another
- **But** Maratha military power was unmatched, so they had to tolerate them

---

## The Siege Fails

**March 1754** - Siege is going badly:

- ❌ Marathas' cannons are **short-range**, not effective
- ❌ They try mines/explosions but the **sandy/desert terrain** makes them useless
- ❌ Emperor **refuses to give them better cannons**
- 🔒 Nothing going in, nothing coming out - classic siege

Imad-ul-Mulk comes personally to inspect (because it's his pet project).

---

## THE TRAGEDY ⚡

**Khande Rao** (Holkar's only son) is inspecting the fort in a palanquin (covered carriage that royals get carried in). 

A cannonball from the fort hits the palanquin and **kills him instantly**.

### The Aftermath

**Malhar Rao Holkar** goes absolutely berserk with grief and rage.

#### The Sati Ritual

Khande Rao had multiple wives:
- The other wives commit **Sati** (burn themselves on his funeral pyre)
- **Ahilya Devi** (one wife) is convinced by Malhar Rao NOT to commit Sati
  - She survives and later becomes famous for social work and temple building
  
> **Historical parallel:** Similar to how Shivaji stopped his mother from committing Sati

---

## Personal Vendetta Begins

Malhar Rao takes the body to **Mathura** (Krishna temple/Yamuna River) for cremation rituals.

Raghunath Rao and the Emperor send condolences, but Malhar Rao makes a vow:

> ### **"I will take Surajmal's head and turn Kumbher fort into mud and dissolve it in the Yamuna"**

Surajmal tries to beg for forgiveness, but **Malhar Rao's grief/anger cannot be calmed**.

---

## The Situation Escalates

What was a professional military campaign becomes a **prestige issue for the entire Holkar army**.

### Why This Changes Everything

- Malhar Rao isn't just some commander - he's **in charge of the Peshwa's entire northern strategy**
- His troops aren't borrowed - they're **his personal army**
- Nobody can stop him now - not even Raghunath Rao (who's technically senior as Nana Saheb's brother)
- **Only Nana Saheb Peshwa himself** could maybe talk him down, but he's not there

### The Power Dynamic

The three Maratha leaders were roughly equal in stature:
1. **Jayapa Shinde**
2. **Malhar Rao Holkar**
3. **Raghunath Rao Peshwa** (first among equals - brother of Nana Saheb)

But now Holkar is driven by personal vendetta, making him unpredictable and unstoppable.

---

## THE STAKES

This is now **personal** - a blood feud between Holkar and Surajmal Jat, happening in the middle of complex Mughal court politics where:
- Nobody actually wants the Marathas to win
- But nobody can stop them either
- Multiple layers of conspiracy and counter-conspiracy
- Personal tragedy transforming strategic campaign into vendetta

## Cultural/Historical Notes

### Sati Ritual
The practice where widows would burn themselves on their husband's funeral pyre. Common social custom of the time, though progressive leaders like Shivaji and Malhar Rao would discourage it.

### Palanquin (Palki)
Covered carriage carried by bearers for royalty and important figures. Had curtains for privacy but allowed occupants to look out.

### Mughal Court Etiquette
- Specific number of salutes required
- Tribute (nazrana) expected
- Complex protocol that outsiders often violated

### Maratha Military Strategy
- Heavily dependent on funding campaigns through "chauth" (25% tax)
- Constantly seeking money to support northern armies
- Professional military class with personal armies loyal to commanders

*This is some Game of Thrones level political complexity - alliances within alliances, secret hopes for failure, and a personal tragedy turning a strategic campaign into a vendetta. Classic 18th century Indian politics.*
