---

## Madhav Singh: From Maratha Ally to Abdali's Friend

### How He Got Power

- Madhav Singh got the **kingdom** because of Maratha intervention
- They helped him come to power
- Now: become a **dead set enemy** of Marathas
- Complete reversal

**His Actions:**
> "And written letters to Abdali and come and destroy Marathas."

**His Relationship with Abdali:**
- Lot of **friendship** between them
- Got along well
- Been having lot of **correspondence**

### Why He Turned

**The Reason:**
- Marathas tried to get **lot of tributes** from him
- On this or that excuse
- Even **after** helping him get power
- He got **irate and angry**
- Short-term Maratha greed = long-term enemy

---

## The Mathura Atrocities (1757)

### What Happened

**1757:**
- Between Mathura and Abdali
- Abdali's forces created lot of **mayhem**
- Lot of **violence**
- All kinds of **atrocities** in Mathura

**Why It Mattered:**
- Mathura is a **holy place** (Krishna's birthplace)
- Major Hindu pilgrimage site

### The Rajput Failure

**What They Didn't Do:**
> "The Rajput princes and kings had not lifted their finger and that is important."

**Their Responsibility:**
- Rajputs considered themselves **protectors of Hindu faith**
- Or so they like to think
- It was **incumbent** upon them to do something
- Send forces
- Resist Abdali

**What Actually Happened:**
- They **didn't do a thing**
- Even though tremendous atrocities
- Didn't lift a finger
- Failed their supposed role

---

## Keshav Rai's Letter to Peshwa (1757)

### The Report

**What Keshav Rai Wrote:**
> "Ambed and Jodhpur kings have written to Abdali that please rescue us from the Marathas."

**The Deal Offered:**
- In Marathi: "Tum cheet sakri karit jau?"
- "If you rescue us from Marathas, we will be in your employment"
- "We will obey you"

**The Translation Note:**
- Old translation or old style Marathi
- Weird phrasing
- But meaning clear

### The Forts

**Context:**
- **Amber Fort** (outside Jaipur)
- Seen on trips to Rajasthan
- These Rajput kingdoms

**Their Weakness:**
> "They can't fight with Abdali, they just are too weak and submissive."

---

## The Intermediary: Najib Khan

### Why Through Najib?

**The System:**
> "Because Rajputs never trusted Abdali, so they used to correspond with Abdali through Najeeb Khan."

**Najib's Role:**
- **Agent of Abdali in India**
- Intermediary between Abdali and Indian powers
- Rajputs would write to Najib
- Or send emissaries to Najib
- Najib would communicate with Abdali

### Why Not Direct?

**The Explanation:**
- Abdali was Muslim based in **Afghanistan**
- Rajputs probably didn't have relationship with him
- Maybe haven't met him
- No direct connection

**Their Strategy:**
> "Their enemy's enemy is our friend. That's their strategy."

**But:**
- Thought Najib would communicate on their behalf
- More comfortable with Indian intermediary
- Even if that intermediary was Afghan

---

## Najib's Intelligence Network (1760)

### Watching Madhav Singh

**What Najib Did:**
- Kept eye on Madhav Singh's correspondence
- Watching who he was writing to
- Specifically: his letters to **Nanasaheb Peshwa**

**What Najib Told Madhav Singh:**
- When Abdali comes in 1760
- He will go to **Dakhan**
- Put **permanent end** to Maratha campaigns in north
- "Smash them"

**Najib's Suspicion:**
> "He kind of thought that maybe some doubles were going on."
- Watching for double-dealing
- Making sure Madhav Singh wasn't playing both sides

---

## The Dattaji Shinde Victory

### One Month Before Dattaji's Death

**Madhav Singh's Letter to Abdali:**
- They (Marathas) will forever not be able to do anything
- Against other powers
- Just give them such a **smash**
- That they will be **totally finished**
- Won't even think about expansion or influence again

### Abdali's Reports to Madhav Singh

**What Abdali Told Him:**
- How he gave good fight
- **Destroyed** both Dattaji Shinde's army **and** Holkar's army
- Dattaji's army really **badly mauled**
- Holkar also got good lesson from Abdali

**The Instructions:**
> "If Holkar comes in your area, don't allow him to get out alive."

**The Implication:**
- Active coordination
- Intelligence sharing
- Strategic cooperation
- Kill orders given

---

## Why Rajputs Wouldn't Join Marathas

### The Distance Created

**The Reality:**
> "Because of the Maratha intervention in Rajput politics, the Rajput princess had, they were distanced from Marathas and they were not going to join Maratha alliance. That was not going to happen."

**How Determined:**
- It was **determined** (decided, inevitable)
- Too much distance between camps
- Too much bad blood
- Based on how things developed in past

### Who Created the Distance

**The Blame:**
> "And it was all created by the short-sighted behavior of Shinde and Holkar."

**What They Did:**
- Short-term limited gain
- Peshwa constantly harassing them (Shinde and Holkar)
- So they said: "Let's try to get more money from these people"
- This kind of behavior
- **Without thinking about what will it do in the future**

**The Consequences:**
- That's why they were **short-sighted**
- Didn't consider long-term consequences
- Created enemies for short-term profit
- Now paying the price

---

## Rajput Neutrality in the Coming Battle

### The Decision

**What They Decided:**
> "In addition, they were not going to take part in the upcoming battle."

**Everyone Sensed:**
- Battle was going to happen
- Everybody knew it

**Rajput Position:**
- Not taking part
- Either on Abdali side
- Or on Maratha side
- Just going to **stay put**

### Why Neutrality?

**The Practical Reason:**
- Rajput kings/princes: **small kingdoms**
- None of them was a big power
- **Together** they could be (significant)
- But they weren't unified

**Their Attitude:**
- Looking at own affairs
- "We are not going to take part in any such thing"
- "You fight it out"
- Didn't have huge armies to send

**But:**
> "They sympathized with the Abdali."

**The Loss:**
> "But their lack of joining the Marathas would be felt."
- Would have been helpful
- But wasn't going to happen

**Their Philosophy:**
> "Our enemy's enemy is our friend, but that's about it. I'm not going to help my enemy's enemy because he's still untrustworthy in their eyes."

---

## The Sikh Situation in Punjab

### The Nascent Power

**The Status:**
- Sikh power had now **arrived**
- Something to be considered
- But still **nascent** (emerging, not fully developed)
- Not a full-blown power yet
- But coming up

**The Relationship:**
> "But there was no connection between the Sikh and the Marathas yet."

---

## The Real Winner of Panipat

### The Observation

**What Was Said:**
> "In some reading I'd done online a few weeks ago, they said really the real winner of the Battle of Panipat was the Sikhs."

**The Agreement:**
> "Yeah, that's true."

**Why:**
- Abdali may have won
- But still **badly hurt**
- At least his army was
- On the way back
- Harassed by Sikhs
- Looted by Sikhs

---

## Sikh-Maratha Relations: Transactional Only

### Not Alliance - Just Trade

**What Actually Happened:**
> "Actually Sikhs benefited, but they helped Marathas to a certain extent, but that was purely on give and take."

**Not Even Strategic:**
- Just **transactional**
- Not alliance
- Not strategic cooperation
- Pure business

### The Situation: 4-5 Months Holed Up

**The Crisis:**
- Marathas holed up in **Panipat area**
- For about **4-5 months**
- Abdali was there also
- Marathas hurting for **supplies**
- For army **and** animals
- Eatables, water, that kind of stuff

**The Scale:**
> "We are talking about 125,000 people there. Wow. So it was like a village."

**The Need:**
- Needed **lots** of supplies
- Had to scavenge and find sources

### The Barter System

**How It Worked:**
- Marathas would approach **Sikhs**
- Sikhs would say: "Okay, **pay up**"
- Marathas would give them **ornaments**
- Or **every valuable** that they had
- Had to give it to Sikhs

**The Nature:**
> "So it was a barter. You know what I mean? So they would trade with them for necessities."

**But:**
> "It was not alliance. It was like, okay, you give us this, we'll give you that."

**Just:**
- **Tit for tat**
- Pure transaction
- No loyalty
- No strategic cooperation

---

## The Siege of Panipat

### Abdali's Strategy

**What Abdali Did:**
- Put a **siege** on Maratha force in Panipat
- Seized/surrounded them
- Cut off supply lines

**The Asymmetry:**
- Marathas had trouble getting supplies
- Abdali's force was **getting supplies**
- He had lot of **allies**
- No trouble getting all supplies for his army

**Maratha Suffering:**
> "But Marathas were really hurting."
- Animals wouldn't have anything to eat
- People didn't have enough food supplies
- Became very tough

---

## Major Themes

### 1. The Only One Willing to Talk

**Suraj Mal's Uniqueness:**
- Out of **all** northern kingdoms
- **Only one** even willing to negotiate
- Not committing, just talking
- That alone was extraordinary

**What It Shows:**
- How isolated Marathas were
- How hostile northern powers were
- Suraj Mal's pragmatism stood out
- Even entertaining the idea = unusual

### 2. Short-Term Greed = Long-Term Enemies

**The Pattern:**
- Marathas help Madhav Singh get power
- Then demand excessive tributes
- He gets angry
- Becomes their enemy
- Writes to Abdali to destroy them

**The Pattern with Rajputs:**
- Shinde and Holkar intervene in Rajput politics
- Extract money, tributes
- For short-term gain
- Create permanent enemies
- Now Rajputs won't help in crisis

**The Lesson:**
> "Short-sighted behavior... without thinking about what will it do in the future."

### 3. Protectors Who Don't Protect

**The Rajput Contradiction:**
- Consider themselves **protectors of Hindu faith**
- "Or so they like to think"
- Mathura (holy city) attacked in 1757
- Tremendous atrocities
- Rajputs: **didn't lift a finger**

**The Reality:**
- Failed their supposed role
- When actually needed = absent
- The claim vs. the reality
- Talk vs. action

### 4. The Intermediary System

**Why Through Najib:**
- Rajputs don't trust Abdali (foreign)
- But need to communicate
- Use Najib as intermediary
- More comfortable with Indian-based agent

**What It Shows:**
- Even collaborators don't trust
- Need intermediary
- Transactional, not trusting
- "Enemy's enemy" logic

### 5. The Intelligence Network

**Najib's Role:**
- Watching Madhav Singh's correspondence
- Keeping eye on who writes to whom
- Suspecting "doubles"
- Active intelligence gathering

**Abdali's Network:**
- Getting reports from multiple sources
- Coordinating with local powers
- Sharing intelligence
- Strategic information advantage

### 6. The Respect Through Protection

**Bhau's Orders:**
- Strict: no burning villages
- No destroying farmland
- No creating problems
- Severe punishment if violated

**The Strategy:**
> "His territory is under my protection, basically."

**What It Shows:**
- Trying to win Suraj Mal over
- Showing respect through action
- Not just promises
- Actual protection of his interests

**The Contrast:**
- With how Shinde/Holkar treated others
- Demanding tributes, causing trouble
- Bhau learning from their mistakes
- But maybe too late

### 7. Together Strong, Apart Weak

**The Rajput Problem:**
> "None of them was a big power. Together they can be, but..."

**The Reality:**
- Small kingdoms
- Individually weak
- Together could matter
- But not unified
- Looking at own affairs

**The Pattern:**
- Could make difference
- If worked together
- But won't
- So collectively irrelevant

### 8. The Siege Economics

**The Asymmetry:**
- 125,000 Marathas = like a village
- Need massive supplies
- Under siege = can't get them
- Abdali has allies = gets supplies easily

**The Sikh Transaction:**
- Marathas desperate
- Give away valuables
- Just to get food
- Not alliance = business
- "You give us this, we'll give you that"

**The Desperation:**
- Animals starving
- People hungry
- Trading ornaments for food
- 4-5 months of this
- Before the actual battle

### 9. The Real Winner

**The Irony:**
> "The real winner of the Battle of Panipat was the Sikhs."

**Why:**
- Didn't fight in the battle
- But profited from both sides
- Marathas paid them for supplies
- Then looted Abdali on way back
- Both sides weakened
- Sikhs emerged stronger

**The Strategy:**
- Stay out of the fight
- Let them destroy each other
- Profit from both
- Emerge when they're weak
- Smart long-term play

### 10. The Sympathy vs. Help Gap

**Rajput Position:**
> "They sympathized with the Abdali. But their lack of joining the Marathas would be felt."

**The Calculation:**
- Sympathize with one side
- But help neither
- Stay neutral
- Preserve own forces
- "You fight it out"

**What It Meant:**
- Could have helped Marathas
- Would have made difference
- But chose not to
- Their neutrality = effectively helping Abdali
- By not helping Marathas

---

## Critical Insights

### The Betrayal Cycle

**Step 1:** Marathas help local power
- Madhav Singh gets kingdom through Maratha help

**Step 2:** Marathas demand payment
- Excessive tributes
- Various excuses
- Constant harassment

**Step 3:** Local power gets angry
- Irate
- Resentful
- Feels exploited

**Step 4:** Local power becomes enemy
- Writes to Abdali
- "Come destroy Marathas"
- Active collaboration with enemy

**The Pattern:**
- Created own enemies
- Through greed
- Could have had allies
- Instead have active opponents

### The Protection vs. Talk Gap

**Rajput Claims:**
- "Protectors of Hindu faith"
- Sacred duty
- Traditional role

**Rajput Actions:**
- Mathura attacked (holy city)
- Tremendous atrocities
- Didn't lift a finger
- Failed completely

**What It Reveals:**
- Claims are propaganda
- Reality is self-interest
- When tested = fail
- The myth vs. the reality

### The "Islam in Danger" Gets Real Support

**Why Rajputs Invited Abdali:**
- Not because they trust him
- Not because they like him
- But because: "Please rescue us from Marathas"
- "We will be in your employment"

**The Implication:**
- Najib's "Islam in danger" argument
- Wasn't just rhetoric
- Had real support base
- Rajput Muslims actively collaborating
- Choosing Afghan Muslim over Maratha Hindu

**The Coordination:**
- Abdali called by Najib Khan
- **And** called by Madho Singh
- Multiple sources calling him
- Coordinated effort
- Not just one agent

### The Intermediate Trust Problem

**The System:**
- Rajputs → Najib → Abdali
- Won't go direct to Abdali
- Don't trust him
- But will trust Najib (sort of)

**What It Shows:**
- Even allies don't trust
- Need layers of intermediation
- Transactional relationships
- No real trust anywhere

**The Irony:**
- Collaborating with foreign invader
- But won't talk to him directly
- Need Indian intermediary
- To collaborate with foreigner

### The Intelligence Advantage

**Najib's Network:**
- Watching correspondence
- Knowing who writes to whom
- Suspecting double-dealing
- Active monitoring

**Abdali's Information:**
- Multiple sources reporting
- Madhav Singh giving updates
- Najib gathering intelligence
- Coordinated information sharing

**Maratha Disadvantage:**
- Don't know this coordination
- Think they're dealing with separate parties
- Don't realize level of cooperation
- Information asymmetry

### The Suraj Mal Exception

**Why He Stood Out:**
- **Only one** willing to talk
- Out of all northern powers
- Not committing, just talking
- But that alone was huge

**What Made Him Different:**
- Strategic pragmatist
- Not ruled by emotion
- Looking at interests
- Willing to negotiate

**The Contrast:**
- Everyone else: automatic hostility
- Suraj Mal: "Let's talk"
- Everyone else: already decided
- Suraj Mal: keeping options open

**The Implication:**
- If more were like him
- Outcome could be different
- But he's the exception
- Not the rule

### The Order vs. Practice Gap

**Bhau's Orders:**
- Very strict
- Very specific
- Severe consequences
- Shows awareness of problem

**The Question:**
- Why give these orders?
- Because his army would otherwise...
- ...burn villages
- ...destroy farmland
- ...create problems

**The Implication:**
- This is **normal** Maratha army behavior
- That's why strict orders needed
- That's why severe punishment threatened
- They have a reputation to overcome

### The Siege Reality

**The Numbers:**
- **125,000 people**
- For **4-5 months**
- Imagine supplying that
- "Like a village"

**The Desperation:**
- Trading valuables for food
- Ornaments for supplies
- With Sikhs who charged
- Animals starving
- People hungry

**Before the Battle:**
- This is BEFORE the battle
- Already weakened
- Already desperate
- Already depleted
- Then had to fight

**The Setup:**
- No wonder they lost
- Abdali had supplies
- Marathas starving
- Siege worked
- Battle was aftermath

### The Winner Who Didn't Fight

**Sikh Strategy:**
- Stay out of battle
- Charge both sides
- Let them weaken each other
- Loot the survivors
- Emerge strongest

**The Wisdom:**
- Didn't have to win battle
- Just had to survive it
- While others destroyed each other
- Smart long-term thinking
- Patience paid off

**The Contrast:**
- Marathas: seeking glory in battle
- Abdali: seeking victory
- Sikhs: seeking survival and profit
- Guess who won long-term?

## What's Coming

**The Situation:**
- Bhau in Suraj Mal's territory
- Trying to win him over with protection
- But Rajputs all hostile
- Actively collaborating with Abdali
- Sikhs neutral (but transactional)
- Madhav Singh giving intelligence to Abdali

**The Setup:**
- 125,000 Marathas will be under siege
- For 4-5 months
- Starving
- Trading valuables for food
- Animals dying
- Then have to fight

**The Questions:**
1. Will Suraj Mal join Marathas?
2. Or stay neutral like Rajputs?
3. Can Bhau overcome all the coordination against him?
4. Can starving army win battle?
5. Will Sikh opportunism pay off?

**The Stakes:**
- Already practically surrounded
- Intelligence network against them
- Supply lines threatened
- Local powers hostile or neutral
- And they don't even know it yet

---

**June 1760: Bhau enters Suraj Mal's territory with the strictest orders his army has ever received: don't burn a single village, don't touch a single field, don't create any problems. Why? Because Suraj Mal is the ONLY northern power even willing to talk. Everyone else? Already decided. Madhav Singh, who got his kingdom through Maratha help, is now writing love letters to Abdali: "Come destroy them please, I'll be your servant." The Rajputs, who call themselves protectors of Hindu faith, stood by and did nothing when Abdali massacred Mathura in 1757. Now they're writing to Abdali through Najib Khan: "Rescue us from the Marathas, we'll obey you." Najib is watching everyone's correspondence, reporting everything to Abdali. And 125,000 Marathas are about to be under siege for 4-5 months, trading their jewelry to Sikhs just to get food for their starving horses. The Sikhs? They're the smart ones. Stay out of the battle, charge both sides, loot the survivors. They're the real winners of Panipat. They just had to wait.**
