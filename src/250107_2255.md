# Suja Goes Neutral & The River Crossing Crisis (1760)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

## The River Crossing: Critical Geographic Reality

**The FaceTime Map Discussion:**
- Ganga and Yamuna rivers shown
- **Delhi and Agra on WEST bank of Yamuna**
- They're NOT in the Doab (between rivers)
- Doab is the area between Ganga and Yamuna

**Abdali's Position:**
- Between Ganga and Yamuna (in the Doab)
- **Across river from Delhi**

**Bhau's Route:**
- Coming from western side of Yamuna
- Coming from Delhi side
- **Must cross Yamuna to get to Abdali**

---

## Bhau's Original Plan

**The Strategy:**
> "His plan was to cross Yamuna and fight Abdali in the Doab where Abdali was located."

**What Actually Happened:**
- When Bhau reached crossing point (near Agra)
- Already **monsoon season**
- Yamuna was **extremely wide**
- **Tough to cross**

**The Result:**
> "So he continued to Delhi. And from Delhi, he went all the way to Kurukshetra, which is north of Delhi. All along, he was on western bank of Yamuna. He never crossed."

---

## The Game-Changing River Crossing

**What Changed Everything:**
- Sometime in September-October
- Abdali **crosses Yamuna from Doab**
- Gets onto **western bank** (same side as Bhau)

**Bhau's Surprise:**
> "That was a huge surprise for Sadashiv Rao Bhau."
- Bhau had gone to Kurukshetra
- Thought he was safe
- Didn't expect Abdali to cross

**Why Abdali Could Cross:**
> "Afghans had good skills to cross rivers."
- After monsoon (Sept 25th crossed with most army)
- Marvelous river-crossing ability

**The Consequence:**
> "That was a game changer, because now war was upon them. Nothing blocking their stuff."

---

## The Chambar River: One Month to Cross

**When:**
- **June 1760** - Bhau crossed Chambar river

**The Problem:**
- Chambar is a **small-time river**
- "River by any stretch of imagination"
- **Took one month to cross**

**The Implication:**
> "If he takes a month to cross Chambar, how long to cross Yamuna? Yamuna is huge river."

**The Reality:**
> "Marathas did not master the technique of crossing rivers."

**The Contrast:**
- Abdali crossed many rivers from Afghanistan to Doab
- Somehow mastered technique
- With elephants, camels, horses, cannons, thousands of people

## Bundeli Couldn't Build the Bridge

**Why It Failed:**
- Couldn't reach Suja physically
- Or maybe sent letter/messengers
- But **couldn't build the bridge out of boats**

**The Threat:**
- Abdali's army (20,000 soldiers) around Itawa area
- Govindapant only had small force
- Constant threat lurking
- Bridge takes several weeks
- "Can be ambushed or something"

**The Conclusion:**
> "It's easier for us to conclude sitting now here. But if you're in situation..." - Much harder in reality.

---

## Suja's Conditions: The Shah Alam Deal

**What Suja Wanted:**
> "If you make Shah Alam as next emperor, and if you make me wazir, then I would come on your side."

**Who Was Shah Alam:**
- Previous emperor had been **blinded**
- Fled for hiding and protection
- Shah Alam was his name
- Imad-ul-Mulk had killed another emperor

**Suja's Calculation:**
- Can't trust Abdali (foreigner who'll leave)
- Can't trust Najib Khan (wants to be wazir himself)
- Once Abdali leaves, who protects Suja?
- No security guarantees

**The Feeler:**
- Sent through **Shyamji Ranganath** (Bhau's representative)

**Bhau's Response:**
> "Yeah, no issue. I will do it."
- Immediately approved
- Willing to make Shah Alam emperor
- Make Suja wazir

---

## The Proximity Problem

**The Reality:**
> "Even with that, Abdali was close to Awadh and Bhau was hundreds of miles away. So that was the problem."

**Why Abdali's Letters Carried More Weight:**
- **Right there** in front of Suja
- 800 pound gorilla sitting nearby
- Bhau far away
- "Not easy to say I'm going with Sadashiv Rao"

---

## Suja's Capital: Lucknow

**The Situation:**
- Capital city was **Lucknow**
- **100 kilometers north**: town of **Bithur**
- Abdali's army camped at Bithur

**The Decision:**
> "Because of that, Mr. Suja-ud-Daula changed his decision and said, I'm going to be neutral. Not taking part in any of this. I am your friend as well as everybody's friend."

**Why He Changed Plans:**
- Originally wanted to go to **Patna** (east)
- But Abdali only 100km away
- Too close for comfort
- If he goes to Patna and Abdali comes to Lucknow → robbed
- Whole thing becomes messy

**His New Plan:**
- Go to **western border** instead
- That's where Abdali is
- Need to make sure it's safe
- Can't leave Lucknow unguarded

---

## The Afghan Alliance Solidifies

**The Rohillas Join:**
- **Dunde Khan**
- **Hafiz Rehmat Khan**
- **Najib Khan**

**Why:**
- Afghan soldiers of fortune
- Settled in India
- "That's where their loyalty lied"
- No questions asked
- Natural alliance

**The Battle Lines:**
> "Because they now were on Abdali side, it was clearly the battle line spectrum."

---

## The Indian vs Afghan Framework

**The Reality:**
> "No matter how you look at it, whether Suja, whether Suraj Mal Jat, whether Rajputs or any others, Bangash - these guys were Indians. They had kingdoms in India. They were not in Afghanistan."

**Afghan Camp:**
- Rohilas
- Abdali (Afghan proper)

**Indian Side:**
- All sitting on sidelines
- Suraj Mal: "Don't want involved, on sideline"
- Bangash: Made Afghan affinity known (forefathers from Afghanistan)

**The Framework:**
> "Indian power brokers vs Afghans - that is kind of clash that is going to take place."

---

## The Communal Color Problem

**Why Suja Mattered:**
> "If it were just between Afghans and Indians, that is good. Can rally Rajputs as Hindu war. But Suja was key because he was Muslim, Shia Muslim."

**If Suja Stays Neutral or Maratha Side:**
- No communal color
- Doesn't become Hindu vs Muslim
- Remains **Afghan vs Indians**
- No religious justification

**If Suja Goes Afghan Side:**
> "Then it becomes Hindu battle. Hindu versus Muslim."

**The Stakes:**
- Suja had **funds**
- Suja had **good-sized army**
- If he goes there: gives them funds AND army
- **Plus** it becomes Hindu-Muslim battle

## Geographic Details

**Lucknow:**
- Suja's capital
- 100km from Bithur

**Bithur:**
- 100km north of Lucknow
- Where Abdali's army camped
- Way too close

**Patna:**
- To the east
- Where Suja wanted to go
- Had to cancel (Abdali too close)

**Kurukshetra:**
- North of Delhi
- Where Bhau went
- Thought he was safe there
- Wrong

---

## Major Themes

### 1. Geography is Destiny
Abdali 100km from Lucknow = Suja goes neutral. If he'd been 500km away, different outcome.

### 2. River Crossings Decide Wars
One month to cross small Chambar. Couldn't cross Yamuna at all. Abdali's mastery = game changer.

### 3. The Communal vs National Frame
If Suja neutral → Afghan vs Indian. If Suja joins Abdali → Hindu vs Muslim. Everything changes.

### 4. Proximity Trumps Promises
Bhau agreed to all Suja's conditions. But Abdali was RIGHT THERE. 800 pound gorilla wins.

### 5. The Surprise Factor
Bhau went to Kurukshetra thinking safe. Abdali's September crossing shocked everyone. War suddenly upon them.

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **June 1760** | Bhau crosses Chambar (takes 1 month!) |
| **June-August 1760** | Bhau reaches Yamuna, can't cross (monsoon) |
| **August 1760** | Bhau continues to Delhi, then Kurukshetra |
| **September 25, 1760** | **Abdali crosses Yamuna** - game changer! |
| **1760** | Suja changes decision, goes neutral (Abdali 100km away) |

---

**Where we left off:** Suja went neutral because Abdali camped 100km from Lucknow. Bhau approved all his conditions but was too far away. Rohillas joined Abdali openly. Battle lines drawn: Afghan vs Indian. But if Suja had joined Abdali, would've been Hindu vs Muslim. Bhau never crossed Yamuna (Maratha weakness). Then Abdali shocked everyone by crossing Yamuna in September. Game changed. War suddenly real.

---

*The river crossing was everything. Marathas couldn't do it. Abdali could. One month to cross tiny Chambar. Impossible to cross huge Yamuna during monsoon. So Bhau stayed on western bank. Thought he was safe at Kurukshetra. Then Abdali's Afghan river-crossing expertise shattered that illusion. September 25th, 1760: Abdali crosses. Bhau's safe distance evaporates. War is upon them.*
