# Abdali's Fifth Invasion Begins (September-December 1759)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Setup: Maratha Control of Punjab

### What Marathas Had Achieved

**By late 1759:**
- Marathas controlled all principal Punjab towns:
  - **Lahore** (capital)
  - **Peshawar** (extreme northwest, border with Afghanistan)
  - **Attaq** (even further than Peshawar)
  - **Multan**
  - **Sarhind**

**The Achievement:**
- First time **Hindu army had gone that far north and west**
- Historic milestone
- Raghunath Rao had established Maratha supremacy earlier
- After Adina Beg died (September 1758), no able governor remained

**The Problem:**
- Marathas were **good at conquering, terrible at securing**
- Raghunath Rao got accolades for reaching Attaq
- But **within one year** it was all falling apart
- No defensive structure properly developed

---

## The Commander Deployments

### Sabaji Shinde at Peshawar

**Who He Was:**
- Part of the Shinde clan
- Younger brother of Jayapa Shinde
- Worked under Dattaji Shinde (the main commander)

**His Position:**
- Posted at **Peshawar**
- **Most critical junction** - Afghanistan's border
- If Abdali's army comes, they enter through here first
- Most difficult post

**The Strategy:**
- Dattaji had placed Maratha commanders throughout Punjab
- One in Lahore, one in Multan, one in various cities
- Covering all important strategic points
- Sabaji got Peshawar - the front line

### Dattaji Shinde at Shukratal

**His Situation:**
- Stuck at **Shukratal** (on Ganga river, eastern bank)
- Entire **monsoon season 1759** wasted there
- Locked in battle with **Najib Khan**
- Trying to cross Ganga, nothing working
- Four or five months stuck

**What Changed:**
- After monsoon ended (October)
- **Shuja Uddaula's Naga troops** reached Shukratal
- Gave Najib numerical advantage
- Najib's position strengthened

## Abdali's Rebellion & Unification (1758-1759)

### Why He Didn't Come in 1758-1759

**The Afghan Tribal Problem:**
- Afghan tribes always battling each other
- Don't want to be under any tribal leader's thumb
- Feel independent

**Abdali's Task:**
- Fighting rebellions in his own country
- Had to unify Afghanistan under his command
- Called "father of Afghanistan" for this reason
- Left mark of unification - more than ever done before

**Result:** Successfully emerged from rebellions, ready to invade India again

---

## The Fifth Invasion Begins (September 1759)

### The Recruitment Drive

**Who Joined Abdali:**
- Soldiers from all over Afghanistan
- **Enthused by idea of loots**
- That was their incentive
- No money in Afghanistan
- India = riches
- "Loot all you can, that's your pay"

### The Two-Route Strategy

**September 1759 departure from Kandahar:**

**Route 1 - Khyber Pass (North):**
- General **Jahan Khan**
- **20,000 men**

**Route 2 - Bolan Pass:**
- **Abdali himself**
- **40,000 soldiers**

**Why Two Routes:**
- These are **only ways** to enter India from Afghanistan
- Westward = big desert (no water, too hot, not hospitable)
- Only camels could cross, but extremely difficult
- Mountain passes = only viable entry points

---

## The June 1759 Defeat That Triggered Everything

### What Happened at Rohutas

**The Battle:**
- Abdali's general **Jahan Khan** led army to Peshawar
- Took Peshawar, then attacked
- Faced **combined Maratha-Sikh armies**
- **Major defeat** at Rohutas (June 1759)

**The Casualties:**
- Jahan Khan **wounded**
- His **son killed**
- Afghans had to **flee**

**The Result:**
> "This reverse in June 1759 convinced Abdali that he had to personally lead a campaign to India."

- Couldn't be entrusted to commanders
- Had to come himself
- One year to the day since Raghunath Rao's celebration at Shalimar Bagh in Lahore

---

## The Afghan Advance (October-November 1759)

### The Route

**Abdali's path:**
- Moving along **right bank of Indus river** (Sindhu)
- Indus comes from Kashmir, enters Afghanistan area, then into Pakistan (was India)
- Passed through **Dera Ghazi Khan**

### Taking Multan

**The Attack:**
- Drove out **Bappuji Trimbak's** force
- Took **Multan** without much resistance

### Sabaji Abandons Peshawar

**The Situation:**
- Facing Jahan Khan approaching with overwhelming force
- **60,000 strong Afghan army** total (20k + 40k)
- Realized it was a losing battle
- **Abandoned Peshawar**

**The Retreat:**
- Short resistance at Attaq
- Marathas fell back on Lahore
- Then retreated east

---

## The Disastrous Retreat

### The Local Hostility

**What Happened:**
- **Hostile peasants** looted retreating Maratha stragglers
- These were **local Punjabi farmers** (not Afghans)
- Marathas lost:
  - Horses
  - Camels
  - Clothes
  - Money

**Why Locals Hostile:**
- Marathas were not locals
- Stretched themselves too thin
- Not properly reinforced
- Not well-strategized

### The Final Count

**Last week of November 1759:**
- Entire Maratha army in Punjab reduced to:
- **Barely a thousand half-naked stragglers**
- **No horses or weapons**
- Reached Dattaji's camp at Shukratal

**Govind Panth Bundele's Assessment:**
> "A great disaster has befallen us."

**The Impact:**
- Fear permeated entire Shinde camp
- These thousand survivors merged with Dattaji's forces
- Brought terror with them

---

## Meanwhile: Sikhs Resist, Army Swells

### Sikh Resistance at Lahore

**What They Did:**
- Offered resistance to Afghans at Lahore
- But **couldn't make a difference**
- Against 60,000 strong Afghan army
- Sikhs were becoming a power but not big time yet
- Light resistance

### The Growing Afghan Force

**Bundele's Description:**
> "The army of Abdali kept swelling in numbers, like a mighty river that has rivulets and streams joining it till it falls into the sea."

**Why It Grew:**
- Tribes along the way joined
- **Baluchistan province** - Baluchi tribal people
- Thought: "When he reaches India and loots, we'll get a portion"
- Like a **popular parade** getting new members
- Everyone wants a piece of the loot

---

## Dattaji's Futile Siege & Belated Response

### The Mistake

**What He Did Wrong:**
- **Persisted with now-futile siege at Shukratal**
- Wasted more time
- Didn't realize threat coming from west
- Called for help from:
  - Ahmad Khan Bangush
  - Some of Suraj Mal's troops
  - **Malhar Rao Holkar** (near Jaipur)

**The Problem:**
- Asked Holkar to face Abdali
- But Holkar **not up to the task**
- Didn't have wherewithal to face Abdali's forces
- Especially 60,000 men

### The Decision to Move

**December 11, 1759:**
- Finally moved towards **Yamuna**
- To face this new threat
- Was at Shukratal (Ganga's banks)
- Now going **west** towards Yamuna
- Plan: Get to eastern bank of Yamuna
- Then probably cross to western bank

**The Reality:**
- Understood big army coming from west
- No point dealing with Najib Khan anymore
- No point going to Bihar/Bengal
- Had to resist Abdali or leave Delhi wide open

---

## Malhar Rao Holkar: The Ineffective Commander

### Where He Was

**1759 activities:**
- Heading towards **Jaipur** to punish **Madho Singh**
- Spent **all of 1759** around kingdom of Jaipur
- **Not being effective**
- Just wasting time trying to get more tribute from Madho Singh
- Madho Singh hadn't been paying up

**The Distance:**
- Was near Jaipur
- Could have easily joined Dattaji
- But kept wasting time

## Critical Insights

### The Maratha Weakness: Conquering vs. Securing

**The Pattern:**
- **Great at offense**
- **Terrible at defense**
- Raghunath Rao reached Attaq - huge achievement
- But **no defensive structure left behind**
- Within one year, everything falls apart

**Why:**
- Didn't develop proper governance
- Didn't establish loyal local administrators
- Didn't fortify positions
- Didn't maintain supply lines
- Just conquered and left

### The Loot Economy

**Abdali's Business Model:**
- Recruit soldiers with promise of loot
- "That's your pay"
- Afghanistan has nothing
- India has riches
- Everyone wants in

**The Growing Army:**
- Like a snowball rolling downhill
- Every tribe along the way joins
- Baluchi people join
- Everyone wants a piece
- Army keeps swelling

### The Geography Problem

**Why Two Passes Matter:**
- Desert to the west = impassable
- Only Bolan Pass and Khyber Pass work
- Mountain passes = chokepoints
- Abdali split army to cover both

**Implication:**
- Marathas should have **heavily fortified these passes**
- Instead, they spread thin across cities
- Lost the critical entry points

### The Peasant Hostility

**The Retreat Disaster:**
- Punjabi farmers looted retreating Marathas
- Why? Marathas were outsiders
- Never won local hearts
- Probably extracted heavy taxes
- No loyalty developed

**The Lesson:**
- Can't hold territory without local support
- Military conquest ≠ political control
- Alienating locals = disaster when retreating

### Dattaji's Strategic Blindness

**The Mistake:**
- Continued siege at Shukratal for **months**
- While Abdali gathering 60,000 men
- While Punjab falling apart
- While only way to Delhi opening up

**Why:**
- Fixated on Najib Khan
- Didn't recognize changing situation
- No intelligence about Abdali's advance
- By the time he moved (Dec 11), **too late**

### Holkar's Ineffectiveness

**The Problem:**
- Near enough to help (Jaipur area)
- But wasting time on tribute collection
- Not equipped to face Abdali anyway
- Old-school tactics
- No modern warfare expertise

**Foreshadowing:**
- This pattern will continue
- Holkar not committed to northern defense
- More interested in personal enrichment

### The Monsoon Factor

**Why 1759 was Lost:**
- Dattaji stuck at Shukratal during **entire monsoon**
- 4-5 months wasted
- Couldn't cross Ganga
- By the time monsoon ended, Najib reinforced
- And Abdali already on the move

**The Climate Weapon:**
- Monsoons immobilize armies
- Abdali timed invasion for post-monsoon
- Marathas couldn't respond during monsoon
- Lost critical months

---

## What's Coming

**The Stage Is Set:**
- Abdali has 60,000 men
- Dattaji has ~25,000 (after 1,000 stragglers joined)
- Dattaji moving to Yamuna
- Holkar still in Rajasthan
- Najib Khan waiting to join Abdali
- Punjab completely lost

**The Math:**
- Marathas outnumbered 2:1 or worse
- No heavy artillery (Dattaji left it behind)
- Winter approaching (Marathas not prepared)
- Political isolation (no allies)
- Abdali has momentum

---

**November-December 1759: The Punjab dream is over. A thousand half-naked stragglers tell the story. Abdali's army swells like a river collecting tributaries - 60,000 strong and growing. Dattaji finally realizes the threat and turns to face it, but he's months too late. Holkar's still playing tribute-collection games near Jaipur. The Maratha army that reached Attaq in glory is now scattered, defeated, terrified. And Abdali hasn't even reached Delhi yet. The disaster has only just begun.**
