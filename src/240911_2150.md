# The Siege of Lahore (1751-1752)
## Abdali's Attack on Punjab Continues

## Abdali's Strategy: Starve Them Out

### Spreading the Army

**Abdali's Tactic:**
- **Spread his army** (wikhudlo) - didn't put them all in one place
- **Target:** Lahore - the major urban center of Punjab
- **Method:** Cut off food and water supplies to the city (Chirasad Todli)
- Starve the population to bring them to their knees

**The Logic:** If you don't have anything to eat or drink, you can't fight any war.

## The Emperor Wants Help... But Safdar Jung Is Busy

### The Mughal Emperor's Order

**What He Wanted:**
- Ordered his wazir **Safdar Jung** to send supplies to Lahore
- Help the Lahore Subedar (Muin Khan) sustain the siege

### The Problem: Safdar Jung Had Other Priorities

**Where He Was:**
- In the **Indo-Yamuna Gangetic Plain** (the fertile region between Ganga and Yamuna rivers)
- Busy fighting with **Khan Bangash** and **Sadulla Khan** (Rohila commanders)
- Multiple skirmishes going on - not one single war

**What He Did:**
- Couldn't send supplies or reinforcements to Lahore
- **Stopped the war** he was fighting
- Went to his capital city of **Lucknow** (also in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, not too far)

**Result:** The guy in Lahore (Muin Khan) was **on his own**.

---

## Why Safdar Jung Didn't Want to Help

### The Complicated Politics

**Two People Needed Help:**
1. **Muin Khan** (Subedar of Lahore)
2. **Kauram Mal** (Subedar of Multan - nearby town/kingdom)

### Safdar Jung's Reasons for NOT Helping

**Problem #1 - Muin Khan:**
- Muin Khan was **Safdar Jung's main rival/competitor**
- Political enemy within the Mughal system

**Problem #2 - Kauram Mal:**
- Had killed **Shahan Vaz Khan** - someone who had sought **protection with Safdar Jung**
- Then took control of Multan
- Betrayed the wazir's protection

**The Dilemma:**
- âŒ Personal reasons: Didn't want to help either of these guys
- ✓ Official duty: As wazir of the Mughal Empire, he was **obligated** to help them

**Result:** Safdar Jung did nothing. 🤷

## Round 1: Muin Khan's Commanders Strike Back

### The Intense Counterattack

**What Happened:**
- Muin Khan's commanders attacked Abdali **very intensely**
- Got success! Abdali had to **retreat**
- For **10 days** there was no remnant of Abdali's army anywhere

**Abdali's Retreat:**
- Retreated all the way back to his base
- Not to be seen anywhere in the neighborhood
- **But** he hadn't given up

### Regrouping Phase

**What Abdali Was Doing:**
- Putting together new army units
- Getting reinforcements
- Gathering weapons, cannons, war materials
- Preparing for the next attack

---

## Round 2: Abdali Returns (March 1752)

### The Return

**Timeline:** Summer was about to start (March)

**Abdali's Move:**
- Came back with **new reinforcements and supplies**
- Came in front of Muin Khan again
- Confronted him properly this time

---

## The Defection of Adina Bae

### The Neighboring Town Betrays

**Adina Bae:**
- Subedar of **Dyaland** (neighboring town to Lahore)
- Officially a **Mughal subedar**
- **Secretly on Abdali's side** (probably)

**The Betrayal:**
- One of his administrative officers defected by deception
- This made Abdali stronger
- Internal betrayal within Mughal ranks

---

## Muin Khan Fortifies Lahore

### The Defensive Strategy

**Understanding Walled Cities:**
- Major cities in those days were **walled in** with gates
- You couldn't just get into the city - had to come through gates
- Cities like Lahore typically had **4-5 gates**
- Each gate had big doors

### Muin Khan's Defense

**What He Did:**
1. **Closed all the city doors/gates**
2. **Put cannons on top of the city walls**
3. Prepared to face Abdali with **10,000 soldiers** inside the walled city

**The Advantage:**
- Cannons on top of walls = higher ground
- Attacking army is in the **lower position**
- Very difficult to wage war from below while cannons fire down
- Massive **disadvantage** for the attacker

---

## Abdali's Letter: "Muslims Are Killing Each Other"

### Abdali Realizes the Cost

**His Calculation:**
- There will be **lots of people killed**
- Cannons on the walls, doors closed
- Not going to be easy
- Would be too costly for his army

**His Decision:** Try diplomacy first.

### The Letter

**Delivery Method:**
- Abdali wrote the letter himself
- Gave it to two of his commanders: **Wazir Shah Wali Khan** and **Jahan Khan**
- They delivered it to Muin Khan

### The Letter's Contents

> **"For four months, Muslims have been killing each other. Will this be acceptable to Allah?"**

**The Invitation:**
- "Without doubt (nishanka), come meet with me"
- "Or send somebody you trust"
- Let's negotiate a truce
- End this fighting

### Why Abdali Wanted to Negotiate

**Strategic Thinking:**
- He was a **good commander**
- Only wanted to attack if casualties would be **limited**
- If it would be a **massacre** of his own troops → not worth it
- Better to find a diplomatic solution

---

## The Famous Meeting

### Muin Khan Accepts

**Decision:** Muin Khan decided to go meet with Abdali in his tent

**Who He Met:** Shah Wali Khan (Abdali's commander-in-chief)

---

## The Negotiation: An Epic Exchange

### Abdali's Gracious Welcome

**Opening Move:**
- Gave Muin Khan a **warm welcome**
- **Congratulated him** for protecting Lahore in such a robust manner
- "You're doing a good job, you defended well"

### The Rapid-Fire Questioning

**Abdali's Style:**
- Fired questions at him **one after the other**
- Multiple questions in quick succession
- Was **very happy** with Muin Khan's answers

---

## The Q&A That Defined the Siege

### Question 1: Why Didn't You Surrender Earlier?

**Abdali:** "Why didn't you surrender to me earlier?"

**Muin Khan's Answer:** "My master (khawinda) is in Delhi. My emperor is in Delhi."

**Meaning:** I'm obligated to fight for my emperor - I can't just surrender.

---

### Question 2: Why Didn't Your Emperor Help You?

**Abdali:** "How come your emperor didn't come to your rescue? Why didn't they send reinforcements?"

**Muin Khan's Answer:** "He didn't send me reinforcement because he knows I'm capable of fighting you off myself."

**Translation:** I'm such a badass commander that my emperor knew I could handle you on my own. 💪

---

### Question 3: What Should I Do With You Now?

**Abdali:** "Now that you are in my control, what should I do with you?"

### 🔥 Muin Khan's Legendary Reply 🔥

This is one of the most famous responses in Marathi history literature:

> **"If you are a MERCHANT (vyapari), then take your reparations (khandani) and let me go."**
>
> **"If you are a BUTCHER (kasai), then kill me."**
>
> **"If you are an EMPEROR (shahenshah), then forgive me."**

### Breaking Down the Epic Answer

**Three Options for Abdali:**

1. **Merchant** → You came for money? Take the reparations we agreed upon and leave
2. **Butcher** → You just want blood? Then kill me now
3. **Emperor** → You're a true ruler? Then show mercy and forgive me

**Why This Is Brilliant:**
- Acknowledges Abdali's power
- Puts the ball in Abdali's court
- Challenges him to define himself
- Poetic and dignified even in defeat
- Forces Abdali to choose his identity

## Geographic Context

**Punjab Region:**
- **Lahore** - Major urban center, walled city
- **Multan** - Nearby town/small kingdom
- **Dyaland** - Neighboring town

**Elsewhere:**
- **Lucknow** - Safdar Jung's capital (Indo-Gangetic Plain)
- **Delhi** - Mughal capital (where the emperor is)
- **Ganga-Yamuna Doab** - Fertile plain where Safdar Jung fought Rohillas

## Strategic Analysis

### Why Abdali Couldn't Take Lahore by Force

**The Math:**
- âŒ City is walled with closed gates
- âŒ Cannons on higher ground (on walls)
- âŒ 10,000 defenders inside
- âŒ Attacking uphill against artillery = massive casualties
- âŒ Not worth the cost

**Abdali's Smart Move:**
- Recognized when military action would be too costly
- Used diplomacy instead
- Saved his army for battles he could win

### Why Safdar Jung's Refusal Mattered

**The Domino Effect:**
- Wazir refuses to help → Muin Khan fights alone
- No reinforcements → Muin Khan must hold the fort with what he has
- Political rivalries → Mughal system starts breaking down
- Internal divisions → Makes it easier for external invaders

---

## Key Themes

1. **The Good Commander** - Abdali knew when to fight and when to negotiate
2. **Political Rivalries Over Duty** - Safdar Jung let personal politics override official obligations
3. **Dignity in Defeat** - Muin Khan's legendary response showed grace under pressure
4. **Walled City Warfare** - Understanding medieval siege dynamics
5. **Internal Betrayal** - Adina Bae's defection showed Mughal weakness
6. **The "Muslim Unity" Card** - Abdali used religious solidarity as a negotiating tool

---

## Cultural Notes

### Khandani (Reparations)
Like what Germany had to pay after WWI - yearly sum paid to a superior power after losing a conflict or making a treaty.

### Walled Cities
Major cities in medieval India were fortified with walls and gates for defense. This gave massive advantages to defenders, especially with artillery positioned on the walls.

### The Three Identities
Muin Khan's categorization of Abdali as merchant, butcher, or emperor reflects medieval political philosophy about the nature of power and conquest.

**Where we left off:** Muin Khan just dropped the most legendary response in the negotiation. What will Abdali's answer be? 👀
