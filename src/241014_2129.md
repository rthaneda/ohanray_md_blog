## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

## The Charminar Standoff (Continued)

### Bushi Gets Kicked Out... Sort Of

**What happened:**
- Bushi (Gursi) was **kicked out** by the Nizam
- But he didn't actually leave
- Took a stand near **Charminar** in Hyderabad
- Charminar = historic tower/area (still exists today, very historic part of city)

### The Cannon Defense

**Bushi's strategy:**
- Set up his **cannon regiment** in the Charminar area
- Fortified the position
- Nizam couldn't do anything about it

**Why the Nizam was helpless:**
- âŒ Couldn't defeat Bushi
- He had the cannon regiment
- Finally gave up: "Okay, fine"
- Didn't want to attack him

**The stalemate:**
- Some discord between them had to be settled
- But Bushi **squatted on all the watch points**
- Fortified his positions
- Basically said: **"This is my land, I'm not going anywhere"**

---

## Why This Impressed the Marathas

### The Demonstration of Power

**Who was watching:**
- **Sadashiv Rao Bhau**
- **Nana Saheb Peshwa**

**What impressed them:**
- Strength projection because of the cannon regiment
- One man with cannons could defy an entire kingdom
- Asked themselves: **"Can we have this capability within our army?"**
- They didn't have it - that kind of capability

---

## The Changing Nature of Warfare

### The Old Days Are Over

**What was fading away:**
- Old-style fighting (Shivaji's tactics)
- Shivaji would routinely go to Pratapgarh or Raigarh
- Get fortified and stay safe in mountain forts

**The new reality:**
- **You could no longer do that so easily**
- Marathas had moved to the north, Bengal, Rajasthan
- Everywhere they were going = **no mountains**

---

## The Mountain Fort Problem: Cannons Change Everything

### Historical Example: Purandar & Vajragarh

**The forts:** Two forts next to each other (visited on trips)
- Purandar
- Vajragarh

**The old assumption:** Mountain forts are safe, impregnable

**The new reality with cannons:**
- **Even in Maharashtra**, you couldn't just hide up in the mountains anymore
- Enemy could go to **neighboring mountain**
- **Point their cannon at your fort**

### The Vajragarh Strategy (Historical Flashback)

**The commander:** Diler Khan (working under Mirza Raju Jai Singh's strategy)

**Jai Singh's advice:**
- "Don't try Purandar - it's heavily fortified"
- "You won't succeed, there will be lots of destruction"
- **"Go to Vajragarh first"**

**What Diler Khan did:**
- Took Vajragarh
- Installed **wooden scaffolding** on Vajragarh
- Started shooting cannons from there
- âŒ Those cannons were still not as powerful as what we're talking about now
- But it was still a clever solution

**The lesson:** Even mountain warfare was being revolutionized by artillery.

---

## What the Marathas Realized They Needed

### The Long-Range Cannon Requirement

**The strategic necessity:**
- Need **long-range cannon regiment**
- These cannons could go **1.5 to 2 kilometers** range
- **HUGE range** - Marathas had never heard of this

**Why this mattered:**
- Shows they were on the lookout for good solutions
- Taking over distant areas with **all fertile land**
- **Not a mountain to be seen**
- "How are you going to fight a war?"

### The Ace in the Hole Philosophy

**The Chanakya principle (repeated):**
- Can't leave warfare up to chance
- If you go one-on-one = **50-50 odds**
- **That's unacceptable**

**The solution:** "We need to have an ace" - and they thought **cannons were that ace**.

---

## Bushi's Position Becomes Permanent

### The Long Haul

**Result of Charminar standoff:**
- Bushi's position with Nizam was **fixed**
- Couldn't be thrown out
- He was **restored** (in a sense)
- There for the long haul

---

## The French in Pondicherry

### Two Years Later

**The French foothold:**
- **Pondicherry** = deep south India
- French were in control there
- Just like British controlled Bengal
- French had their territory in Pondicherry

---

## The Mercenary Problem: Ibrahim Khan Gardi

### The Hired Gun Mentality

**Who he was:**
- Cannon regiment commander
- Trained by Bushi
- Working for Marathas now

**The problem with his mentality:**
- Demanded regular **monthly salaries** (first of every month)
- "No compromise on that one"
- "I will do anything and everything you ask me to do"
- "I'll be fair in the bargain, but you have to be fair with me"

**The clash with Maratha culture:**
- Traditional Maratha soldiers didn't get fixed monthly salaries
- Payment was irregular
- Sometimes paid through looting rights
- "Loot an area, keep what you want" = that's your salary
- Minor things yours to keep
- Huge loot = Peshwa gets a piece

**The contrast:** Ibrahim Khan = "Us baby" - wanted modern employment terms in a medieval army structure.

---

## The Baggage Problem

### What "Noteworthy" Means (Lakshani)

**When the army moved, it carried:**
- Tents
- Grains
- Cooks
- All supplies
- Everything had to be carried for long distances

**The consequence:** Became **difficult to move quickly**

---

## Bajirao I's Lightning Speed (The Gold Standard)

### How Bajirao Moved Fast

**His method:**
- Ate lunch and dinner **right on horseback**
- One of the reasons he was very popular
- Moved **light** - not too much stuff

**The advantage:**
- Could cross distances in **1 day** that enemy thought would take **3 days**
- He was quick
- One of a kind

---

## The Problem: Regular Army vs. Elite Force

### You Can't All Be Bajirao

**The new reality:**
- Now it was a **regular army**
- Can't expect everyone to be like Bajirao
- Normal logistics required

---

## The Pilgrim Problem

### Civilians Tagging Along

**What was happening:**
- People wanted to go to places in the north
- Do pilgrimage in **Kashi** (Varanasi)
- In those times: **very treacherous to travel alone**
- Would get looted or killed
- Wars happening everywhere

**The solution people found:**
- Travel **with the Maratha army**
- Do pilgrimage
- Join back when army returns
- Come back with army for protection

**Why this was bad for the army:**
- âŒ Civilians were a **drag** on military operations
- Not useful for anything
- Can't cook, can't clean (not their job)
- Not helpful to army operations
- **Can't leave them behind** (you put them in harm's way)
- They'd try to catch up anyway
- Becomes your burden
- Gives away your position potentially

**The strategic mobility issue:**
- Bajirao's model was swift moves
- No one could follow him
- Called **"strategic mobility"**
- Pilgrims **drag you down**

**But this was what was happening** - stuck with these civilian tagalongs.

---

## The Warrior Quality Problem

### Not Trained Warriors

**The recruitment issue:**
- "**Kaslele**" = warriors
- But many **were not trained warriors**

**The Pendari problem:**
- **Pendaris** = actually **robbers**
- âŒ Not formally trained
- Heart and soul **not in fighting**
- Just wanted to quickly **make a buck and leave**
- âŒ Not courageous necessarily

**The forced recruitment:**
- All kinds of people recruited
- Not properly trained
- Not mentally prepared to be warriors
- "You have to have dedicated people"
- Fighting was **forced upon them** - not their choice

**Why this happened:**
- Marathas were in a **hurry to recruit**
- Didn't have time to properly train everyone
- Didn't create proper mindset
- **Needed numbers** - had to have 100,000+ people
- âŒ Not an effective or uniform army

---

## The Cleanup Crew

**What these low-quality troops did:**
- When the war was finished
- They'd do the **cleanup work**
- Deal with little pockets of resistance
- Mop-up operations
- Support functions

---

## The Teeth-to-Tail Ratio

### Military Efficiency Metric

**The concept:**
- **"Teeth"** = people who really do the fighting
- **"Tail"** = people who support the entire operation
- There's a ratio of actual troops to support staff

**The problem:**
- âŒ Don't want **too much support staff**
- Lose your fighting ability
- Maratha army had **too much of their army comprising backup support staff**

**Who the support staff included:**
- Barbers
- Cooks
- Servants
- âŒ Not going to fight
- âŒ Not trained
- âŒ Not interested
- Won't help you in battle
- Becomes a **burden**
- Have to **protect them**

---

## The Loss of Strategic Mobility

### What Made Shivaji and Bajirao I Effective

**Their model:**
- **Strategic mobility**
- Could move fast
- Pounce on enemy
- Fight 4-5 hours
- **Immediately vanish**

**What changed:**
- Now there were **restrictions on moving that fast**
- Substantial support staff
- **Can't move quickly** because:
  - Support staff not in top physical condition
  - Cook doesn't need to be physically fit - his job is to cook
  - No reason for support staff to be athletic

**The result:** Fundamentally a **more hamstrung army**

---

## The New Fighting Style

### Stand and Fight

**Old Maratha model:**
- Fight and vanish
- Hit and run
- Guerrilla tactics

**New model:**
- **Fight to the finish** in front of each other
- **Stand and fight**
- Win the war and **entrench your feet in new land**
- **Keep it under your control**
- Don't just disappear, loot, and leave

**Why the change:**
- In the north: **no forts, no mountains, no mountainous area**
- Fighting more like **Mughals now** (of a generation before)

---

## The Mughal Model

### Why Mughals Fought That Way

**Their advantages for their time:**
- Had standing armies
- Large armies
- **No mountains** (so couldn't use guerrilla tactics)
- For their times: **very advanced killing machine**
- Europeans weren't as advanced then

---

## The Technology Gap Widens (1750s)

### Times Are Changing

**By 1750s:**
- Europeans starting **Industrial Revolution**
- More advanced technology
- Before: they just had boats
- Even during Aurangzeb's time, his army was pretty good
- Europeans couldn't really match Mughal armies then

**Now:**
- Times are changing
- Europeans doing **R&D** (research and development)
- Indians **have not done it**
- Technology gap widening

**Why Peshwa was impressed:** Understood the power of cannon regiment - this was new and unforeseen. Needed to be kept up with.

---

## The First Half vs. Second Half Problem

### Purvardha vs. Uttaradha

**18th century divided:**
- **Purvardha** = first half (up to 1750)
- **Uttaradha** = second half (after 1750)

**The assessment:**
- Up until 1750: Maratha fighting prowess was **so-so**
- Had not gotten state-of-the-art fighting techniques/weapons
- **Let alone the discipline**
- âŒ Not a professional army

---

## The Superpower Problem: Can't Just Win and Leave

### The New Responsibility

**When you're a superpower:**
- Win over an area → **have to rule that area**
- **Can't just move away**
- Win a province → **must put in administration**

**Why this matters:**
- Can't say "we won the war, going home now"
- Main prize of winning = **collect revenue**
- Need taxation system
- Need administration
- Need to **rule over there**
- Rule **nicely** = well-administered, good government

---

## The Administration Problem

### Good at War, Bad at Governance

**The Maratha weakness:**
- ✅ Good at **winning over new provinces**
- âŒ Weak at **putting together effective administration**
- âŒ Not their strong suit

**The consequence:**
- Win over an area
- **Within two years: lose the area**
- Why: didn't secure it or administer properly
- Didn't pay attention
- Didn't put together good administrative system
- Didn't maintain strong army base there

**The cycle:**
- Win it one year
- Next year: rivals come back, it's gone
- Have to take it back again
- **Game of cat and mouse**

**The verdict:** Not good at putting in place good administration. That was **not their forte**.

---

## Critical Insights

### The Mercenary Loyalty Problem

**Ibrahim Khan Gardi's demands:**
- Fixed monthly salary
- Professional employment terms
- "Fair bargain" mentality
- âŒ **Fundamentally at odds with Maratha culture**

**Traditional Maratha way:**
- Irregular payment
- Loot-based compensation
- Flexible terms
- Loyalty through shared struggle

**The clash:** Trying to integrate modern mercenary force into medieval army structure = recipe for problems.

### The Teeth-to-Tail Disaster

**The bloated army:**
- Too many cooks, barbers, servants
- Not enough actual fighters
- **Can't move fast** (logistics drag)
- **Can't fight effectively** (too many non-combatants to protect)
- **Lose Bajirao's strategic mobility**

**The trade-off:**
- Need big numbers (intimidation, occupation)
- But big numbers = slower, less effective
- Quantity ≠ quality

### The Pilgrim Burden

**The cultural obligation:**
- Can't leave civilians to die
- Have to protect pilgrims
- They slow you down
- Give away positions
- Drain resources

**No good solution:** Part of being the dominant power - people expect protection.

### The Administration Curse

**The catch-22:**
- Must win territories to expand
- Must administer territories to keep them
- âŒ **Can't do the second part**
- Win → lose → win again = exhausting

**Why it matters:**
- Revenue = power
- Can't collect revenue without administration
- Can't maintain empire without revenue
- **Stuck in perpetual reconquest**

### The Technology Trap

**1750 = inflection point:**
- Before: competitive with or superior to Europeans
- After: falling behind rapidly
- Europeans doing R&D
- Indians not keeping up
- **Gap will only widen**

**The cannon obsession makes sense:**
- Recognized they were behind
- Saw cannons as equalizer
- But didn't fix underlying problem (no R&D capacity)
- Buying technology ≠ building technology

### The Strategic Mobility Loss

**What made Marathas great:**
- Bajirao's lightning strikes
- Unpredictable movements
- Enemy couldn't prepare
- **Based on being LIGHT and FAST**

**What killed it:**
- Becoming a "regular army"
- Support staff bloat
- Civilian tagalongs
- Heavy logistics train
- **Can't do guerrilla warfare anymore**

**The transformation:**
- Mountain warriors → plains armies
- Hit-and-run → stand-and-fight
- Shivaji's model → Mughal model
- **But without Mughal administrative capacity**

---

*The Marathas were stuck between worlds: too "modern" to use their old guerrilla tactics, but not modern enough to compete with European technology. Their army had ballooned into a slow-moving city on wheels - cooks, barbers, pilgrims, and all. They'd abandoned Bajirao's lightning mobility for Mughal-style set-piece battles, but lacked the Mughal capacity to actually govern what they conquered. They were buying cannons from mercenaries, but not building the scientific capacity to make their own. And most fatally: they could win wars, but they couldn't win peace. Every province they conquered, they'd lose within two years. The superpower that couldn't actually rule.*
