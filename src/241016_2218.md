# The Conspiracy Against the Marathas (1754-1756)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Ideologue: Shah Waliullah

**Background:**
- Father was a Sufi
- Studied in Arabia and became a **Jihadi** (radicalized)
- Not a fighter himself - more of a **theologian and ideologue**
- His role: Inspire people and orchestrate alliances

### The Crisis He Saw

**The Muslim "Plight" in India (as described by Waliullah):**

| Aspect | Muslim Status | Hindu Status |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Governance** | No real power | All advisors and governance structure |
| **Wealth** | Poverty and difficulties | All prosperity and riches |
| **Political Power** | Pitiable state (Kevil Wani) | Rising dominance |

**The Core Problem:**
- Mughal Empire was collapsing
- Marathas were becoming the dominant power
- **No Muslim power in India could stand up to the Marathas**
- Islam itself seemed at risk of being "uprooted from India"

---

## The Letters to Abdali

**Waliullah's Strategy:**
Looking for a **"protector" (Ratha)** of Islam - someone who could stop Maratha hegemony.

**Why Abdali?**
- Only person with the military power to stop the Marathas
- Afghanistan's king with proven military capability
- Had successfully invaded India twice before without being stopped

**The Connection:**
1. Waliullah → Najib Khan (they knew each other from school)
2. Najib Khan → Ahmad Shah Abdali (fellow Afghan, natural connection)

**The Pitch:**
> "Islam will be uprooted from India if you don't help. The Maratha power is increasing, Muslim power is decaying. We need you."

**Abdali's Response:**
- He was already having internal issues in Afghanistan that needed resolution
- Once those were settled, he'd come to India
- **But he needed a reason and local allies** - you can't just walk into a foreign country without support
- These letters gave him exactly what he needed: **invitation + local allies**

## The Rise of Najib Khan: From Soldier to Kingmaker

### The Humble Beginnings

**Starting Point:** Just a common soldier - nothing special initially

**The Breakthrough:**
- Proved himself as a capable fighter
- Got recognized by **Dunde Khan** (a major Rohilla chieftain)
- Dunde Khan was so impressed he **married his daughter to Najib**
- This marriage opened the door to the leadership circle

### Building a Kingdom

**The Dowry:**
- Got a few villages near Saharanpur as part of the marriage deal
- Small region, but now he was a **chieftain with territory to rule**

**The Expansion:**
- With the Mughal emperor being weak and ineffective, Najib expanded his territory
- Flew under the radar and grabbed more land
- Similar strategy to how Shivaji expanded under the Adil Shahan Sultanate

### Climbing the Ladder (1751-1754)

| Year | Position | Achievement |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **1751** | Entered service of Safdar Jang (Wazir) | Became 1,000 Mansabdar |
| **1751-1753** | Inside observer | Studied Marathas, Mughals, Rohillas up close |
| **1753** | Switched sides to Emperor | Protected Delhi from Safdar Jang + Surajmal Jat |
| **1753** | Major promotion | Became **5,000 Mansabdar** - now a top commander |
| **1754** | Given Saharanpur region | Solid power base in Rohilkhand |

**Key Move - The Delhi Defense (1753):**
- Najib + Imad-ul-Mulk defended Delhi against the combined force of:
  - Safdar Jang
  - Surajmal Jat
- Marathas were also helping the Emperor during this
- Successfully defended → massive promotion to 5,000 Mansabdar

**His Position by 1754:**
- One of the major commanders in North India
- Had his own kingdom in Rohilkhand
- Still loosely allied with Mughals (vassal king arrangement)
- **Inside scoop on all the major players** from years of observation

## Why Najib Wanted Abdali

### The Fear Factor

**Najib's Concerns:**
- Marathas were expanding rapidly
- He knew he'd be "forever at the mercy of Marathas"
- As an Afghan in India (Rohilla), he had natural sympathies with Abdali
- Wanted to preserve Afghan/Muslim power in North India

### The Vision

**Najib's Pitch to Abdali:**
> "You should rule India by proxy. Replace the Mughals entirely - they're weak and useless. Give us (Rohillas) importance. We can be your local representatives. We'll work together."

**The Logic:**
- Mughals were dying anyway
- Why not replace them with Afghan rule?
- Najib could be Abdali's man in India
- Get rid of Maratha hegemony permanently

**What He Wanted:**
- Break Maratha power completely
- End their importance and overall hegemony
- He knew only Abdali could do it

---

## The Third Conspirator: Madho Singh of Rajasthan

### Why a Rajput King Wanted to Ally with Abdali

**Recent History:**
- Marathas had been interfering heavily in Rajasthani succession battles
- They decided which princes could rule and which couldn't
- Demanded tributes constantly
- Created massive resentment

**The Calculation:**
- Rajputs were already okay being vassal kings under Mughals
- **But Marathas were too headstrong and intrusive**
- Better to pay tribute to distant overlords than deal with Maratha interference

**The Goal:**
> "We need to drive them south of the Narmada River. Stay in your territory. We can have long-distance relations, but don't come here and tell us who can rule."

**The Price:**
- Rajputs were willing to pay a steep price to cut down Maratha power
- Didn't want to eliminate Marathas entirely
- Just wanted them back in the Deccan, out of Rajasthani politics

---

## The United Front Forms

### The Alliance Against the Marathas

**Members of the Anti-Maratha Coalition:**
1. **Shah Waliullah** - The ideologue, writing letters
2. **Najib Khan** - The connector, had direct line to Abdali
3. **Madho Singh** - Rajasthani king, fed up with interference
4. Various other Muslim powers (Rohillas, remnants of Mughals)

**What They All Wanted:**
- Different goals but common enemy
- Cut down Maratha importance
- Drive them back to the Deccan
- Restore some form of Muslim/Northern power structure

**What This Gave Abdali:**
- **Natural local allies** - exactly what he needed
- Invitation to intervene
- Intelligence about who's who
- Guides for navigating Indian politics
- Religious justification (protecting Islam)
- Political justification (restoring order)

## The Maratha Mistakes: Why They Became So Unpopular

### The Military Success Without Political Wisdom

**What Marathas Did Right:**
- Unmatched military power
- Expanded all the way to Punjab
- Even crossed Punjab and went close to Afghanistan
- Raghunath Rao's campaigns were militarily brilliant

**What Marathas Did Wrong:**

#### Mistake #1: No Administration Left Behind
- Conquered Punjab but **left no one to run the administration**
- No day-to-day governance structure
- No follow-up after military victories
- Just conquered and came back

#### Mistake #2: Lost All Alliances in the North
- Made military victories but didn't maintain political alliances
- Interfered too much in local succession battles
- Became too headstrong and demanding
- Created enemies out of potential allies

#### Mistake #3: Didn't Understand Northern Politics
> "They didn't understand politics because you can't just keep making military victories without understanding that you're losing alliances."

**The Result:**
- Created a **united front against themselves**
- Pushed everyone - Muslims, Rajputs, Afghans - into each other's arms
- Made themselves the common enemy
- **Marathas were partially responsible for this unity**

---

## The Stage is Set

### What's Coming

The book hints that a **BIG CATALYST** is about to happen - something that will force the Marathas to say:

> "This can't be tolerated. We have to deal with this NOW."

And once that happens, Abdali will have to respond, and the collision course toward Panipat will be inevitable.

## Cultural/Historical Notes

### Mansabdar System
Mughal military rank system:
- **1,000 Mansabdar** = Commander of 1,000 troops
- **5,000 Mansabdar** = Major commander, top-tier position

### Vassal Kingdom Model
- Keep your internal affairs autonomous
- Pay tribute to overlord
- Provide military support when needed
- Better than constant warfare

### The Afghan Connection
- Rohillas = Afghan settlers in North India
- Natural cultural and ethnic ties to Afghanistan
- Easy for Abdali to find allies among them

### Political Intelligence Value
Najib's years inside different courts gave him invaluable knowledge:
- How Marathas operate
- Mughal weaknesses
- Who's allied with whom
- Perfect position to be Abdali's guide

## Key Themes

1. **The Power of Letters** - Shah Waliullah never fought a battle, but his letters to Abdali helped trigger a war
2. **The Rise of the Self-Made Man** - Najib Khan went from common soldier to kingmaker
3. **Military Success ≠ Political Success** - Marathas won battles but lost the political game
4. **The Enemy of My Enemy** - How diverse groups (Muslims, Rajputs) united against a common threat
5. **Local Allies Make Foreign Invasions Possible** - Abdali couldn't invade without Najib and others
6. **The Importance of Administration** - Conquering without governing creates power vacuums
