# Nana Sahib & Sadashiv Rao Bhau: The Pre-Panipat Tension (1750s)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Cousin Relationship: Tension & Trust

**Who They Were:**
- **Nana Sahib Peshwa** (3rd Peshwa, in charge)
- **Sadashiv Rao Bhau** (cousin, military commander)
- Both fathers were brothers (direct cousins, not uncle-nephew)

**The Problem:**
- Nana Sahib feared Bhau as potential competitor
- Wife **Gopika Bhai** may have fueled suspicion
- Bhau could have been Peshwa himself (same family line)
- Nana Sahib wanted his own son to inherit, not Bhau

**The Threat Dynamics:**
- Bhau "got too brash"
- One-sided actions made Nana Sahib unhappy
- Bhau may have threatened to go to Kolhapur & become Peshwa there
- But Nana Sahib appointed him commander-in-chief anyway (strategic move)

**The Resolution:**
- Given Bhau responsibilities & autonomy
- Made him second-in-command
- But kept close watch through son Vishwas Rao

## Panipat Preparation: The Strategic Setup

**The Decision:**
- Martial north campaign seemed like "given" victory
- Confidence: "No two ways about it, we will win"
- Control entire India seemed possible after victory

**The Problem:**
- If Bhau gets credit for huge victory = threat to Nana's son's future
- Solution: Send **Vishwas Rao** (19 years old) with Bhau
- Vishwas = "sovereign representative"

**The Clever Arrangement:**
- Bhau = actual military commander-in-chief
- Vishwas = nominal sovereign authority figure
- Bhau had to consult Vishwas on decisions
- Vishwas had no military experience, just symbolic role

**How It Worked:**
- Bhau would brief Vishwas 5 minutes before formal meeting
- Vishwas would propose same decision in meeting
- "Perfect harmony" between them despite the setup
- No actual tension (Vishwas trusted & respected Bhau)

**Vishwas's Testimony:**
- Wrote letters to father from battlefield
- Praised Bhau: "You will not get a brother like Bhau"
- "Bhau is loyal and will serve you"
- "Forget about any backstabbing"
- Completely defended Bhau's character

## The Satara Crisis: Tara Rani's Ambitions

**The Situation:**
- Ram Raja (adopted heir) back in Satara
- Tara Rani demanded he accept her as surrogate authority
- He refused
- She imprisoned him
- Removed him from line of succession

**The Family Problem:**
- Ram Raja had 2-3 wives (strategic alliances)
- Married into powerful Maratha families
- Families upset their daughters lost status
- Now married to nobody (inmate, no succession)

**Nana Sahib's Dilemma:**
- Couldn't get involved in royal family politics
- Either side had problems for him
- Decided to stay away from Satara issues

---

## The Karnataka Campaign

**Why Now:**
- Nizam vulnerable (succession chaos with Charles de Bushy)
- French hired general Bushy put new Nizam (Salabat Jang) on throne
- Weak moment to attack

**Who Went:**
- Nana Sahib himself (unusual for him)
- Sadashiv Rao Bhau
- **Shinde & Holkar couldn't come** (stuck in Rajasthan succession politics)

**The Risk:**
- Left Pune & Satara unprotected
- Hoped situation would stay calm

---

## Tara Rani Strikes: The Political Bomb

**What She Did:**
- Got ambitious while Peshwa was away
- Invited prominent Maratha commander to Satara
- Plan: Get rid of Peshwa, put herself in charge

**The Executor:**
- **Damaji Gaikwad** (based in Gujarat)
- Called by Tara Rani to attack Peshwa
- Attacked one Peshwa contingent in Khandesh
- Defeated them

**The Attack on Pune:**
- Damaji came to Pune itself
- Shanwarwada (Peshwa palace) NOT defensible
- "Grand bungalow" with walls, but no moat
- Can be taken by cannons
- Not meant as hardcore fort

**The Escape:**
- Peshwa family fled to **Shivagad Fort**
- Nearest secure location
- Took everything to safety

---

## The Result

**For Peshwa:**
- Can't go to Karnataka now
- Must deal with home crisis
- Damaji continues toward Satara
- Will meet Peshwa's loyal commanders

**For Empire:**
- Fratricidal war (Maratha vs. Maratha)
- Commander gets involved in Satara politics
- Tara Rani makes dangerous move

## Critical Insights

### 1. The Arranged Military Leadership
Genius move by Nana Sahib: Put Bhau in charge militarily, Vishwas nominally in charge sovereignly. Gives Bhau real power, Vishwas gets credit, Nana controls both.

### 2. Perfect Harmony Despite Political Setup
Most political setups like this fail. Bhau & Vishwas actually trusted & respected each other. No backstabbing despite suspicious setup.

### 3. The Tara Rani Wildcard
Nobody expected Tara Rani to move. She'd been sidelined for 10+ years. Now she sees vulnerability & strikes.

### 4. The Damaji Problem
Damaji responds to Tara Rani's call. Shows commanders still think Satara sovereign = real power. Peshwa hasn't fully established de facto rule.

### 5. The Wrong Time for Crisis
Nana Sahib going to Karnataka at same moment Tara Rani moves. Bad timing. Had to abandon campaign to handle home crisis.

## Key Quotes

> "You will not get a brother like Bhau" — *Vishwas Rao about Bhau in letters home*

> "Perfect harmony between them" — *Description of Vishwas & Bhau relationship*

> "This is given, we are going to win" — *Maratha confidence about Panipat before campaign*

> "Shanwarwada is not meant to be a hardcore defensible position"

**Where We Left Off:** Nana Sahib sent his son Vishwas Rao with Bhau to fight in the north (Panipat). While they're gone, Tara Rani strikes at home, sending Damaji Gaikwad to attack. Peshwa family flees to Shivagad. Crisis on the home front just as Panipat war is starting. The timing is catastrophic.

---

*Nana Sahib wanted Bhau's military genius but feared his ambition. So he put Bhau in charge with his son nominally in charge. Clever political move. But it worked only because Bhau & Vishwas actually trusted each other. Meanwhile, Tara Rani saw the Peshwa was gone and struck. Damaji came to attack. By the time Nana Sahib realized the home front was on fire, he couldn't get back in time. The empire was split between two battles: Panipat in the north, Satara crisis in the south. And Panipat would be lost.*
