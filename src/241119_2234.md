## The British: 100 Years of Waiting

### The Long Game

**Their Timeline:**
- Been in India as **merchants** for at least **100 years**
- Working in trade, commerce
- But **always interested in ruling India**
- Even when they came 100 years ago
- Were just **waiting for their time to come**

2. **Mughal power on the wane**
3. **Marathas basically interested in looting**
4. **Nagpur Bhosle family** had troops in Bengal

- Now they are **hostile powers**
- Not just looking at Marathas from a distance anymore
- They've **engaged in battles** in Punjab

- Afraid he would lose the battle

---

---

## The Battle of Plassey (1757)

### How It Happened

**The Tension:**
- Already tension between **Siraj ud-Daula and British**

---

## The Betrayal

### Mir Jafar's Treachery

**Who Was Mir Jafar:**
- **Commander** of Siraj ud-Daula
- Supposedly loyal
- Acting as though he wanted to support his Nawab
- But it was **just a drama**

**What Robert Clive Realized:**
- Mir Jafar was **disloyal**
- Even though acting loyal
- Easier to **deal with this Nawab militarily**

**The Deal:**
- Mir Jafar and **Raja Durlabh** (another commander)
- Were **given money** by the British
- Also given **promise** of rewards
- Once British come to power
- They will be **rewarded appropriately**

---

## The Battle

### What Actually Happened

**The Forces:**
- Siraj ud-Daula's army was **much bigger**
- Than Robert Clive's army
- **Just in terms of sheer size**

**But:**
- Mir Jafar and Raja Durlabh
- **Remained neutral**
- Or **just left the battlefield**
- Didn't fight with their troops

**The Result:**
- British **defeated** the much larger army
- Because commanders didn't fight

---

## Siraj ud-Daula's End

### Flight and Death

**What Happened:**
- Siraj **fled the battlefield**
- Successful in **fleeing away**
- His army was **defeated** by much smaller British army
- Battle happened around **June 23**

**July 2, 1757:**
- He was **captured**
- **Killed by Mir Jafar's son**

**Why:**
> "Mir Jafar must have been **irate** with Nawab Siraj ud-Daula. He took **revenge**. This guy was so **arrogant and difficult to deal with**. The relationship was very bad."

---

## British Take Control

### The Facade

**What British Did:**
- Made **Mir Jafar** the new Nawab
- For **namesake only**
- To keep people **in the dark** about what was happening

**The Reality:**
> "Real power **rested with the British**. They started getting all the **political controls**, the **power controls**. Mir Jafar was the **facade**."

**The Transformation:**
- So far: **merchants** (buying, selling)
- Now: Getting **political control**
- Mir Jafar knew he had **no real control** over Bengal
- British were really going to **rule** by keeping him in front

---

## Peshwa Loses Bengal

### Before He Could Move

**What Happened:**
- Peshwa in Pune was **keeping an eye on Bengal**
- **Wanted to get power** in Bengal
- But **before he could move and do anything**
- British **already in power** in Bengal

**How:**
- Mir Jafar and Raja Durlabh
- **Facilitated** British takeover
- Of the **entire province** of Bengal
- **Huge province**
- Very **prosperous** (revenue from taxes)

**The Advantage:**
- Britishers had a **disciplined army**

**The Surprise:**
> "This happened **suddenly** without Peshwa understanding what is going on there. How bad the situation in Bengal was."

---

## The Victory Parade

### Robert Clive's Realization

**What Happened:**
- Battle of Plassey was **famous battle of 1757**
- **First time** Britishers fought a battle in India
- Before that: **never had done any battling**
- And they **won it**

**The Parade:**
- Had barely **5,000 troops** under Robert Clive
- To commemorate victory
- Took out a **victory parade** through town of Plassey
- Plassey was **very small town** (10,000-15,000 people)

**The Scene:**
- British soldiers going through village
- With **musical things** (drums, etc.)
- In line, in very **disciplined fashion**
- Middle of the road
- On **both sides**: people of Plassey village watching
- **Robert Clive in the lead**
- Some soldiers dead, some injured
- Those in good shape went through in victory parade

---

## Clive's Question

### Why Are They So Peaceful?

**What He Was Thinking:**
- **Thousands of villagers** on both sides watching
- He wondered: **Why** are these people watching in **very peaceful manner**?

**His Reasoning:**
> "I am a **total foreigner**, so are my soldiers. We don't share their **looks, skin color, religion, language, nothing, culture**. And yet they are very **peaceful** and they are **allowing us** to take out this victory parade."

**The Realization:**
- Literally **thousands of villagers**
- Could easily attack them
- Why are they so **peaceful** and **tolerating** all this?

---

## The Research

### What Clive Discovered

**What He Did:**
- Kept doing **research** of what is going on in Bengal
- Later wrote it in his **memoirs**

**What He Found:**
> "People of Bengal were so **sick and tired** of Nawab Siraj ud-Daula and his governance, administration, the way he **collected taxes** and he **ruled on his whims** without any regard to what was good for his people, that they were **extremely angry, upset, incensed**."

**Their Outlook:**
> "We want **anybody but Siraj ud-Daula**."

**That is the extreme to which they were driven.**

---

## The Stone Metaphor

### Why They Didn't Resist

**Clive's Thought:**
> "Even if **every villager** picks up **one stone** and throws it at our contingent marching through the village streets, **we'll all be dead**. There are **thousands upon thousands** of people watching."

**But:**
- **None of them wanted to resist**
- Even though British = **total foreigners**
- Don't follow their **religion, language, skin color, nothing**
- Yet they're **happy**, they **look happy**

**Why:**
> "All this was possible because the **governance was so terribly bad**. They just said, 'Okay, fine, maybe this guy is **better** and we'll have some **better days**.' So they **tolerated** all that."

---

## The Shivaji Comparison

### Understanding the Magic

**On That Background:**
> "Now you can understand the **Shivaji magic**. Shivaji was **exactly opposite**."

**Why Shivaji Was Successful:**
- His governance was **top notch**
- Always considered **welfare of his citizens** to be **number one priority**

**The Difference:**
- Was **unusual for the time**
- He was **loved by his people**
- Wherever he ruled
- Didn't matter where
- Wanted to provide **best governance**
- **Administration**
- **Tax collection apparatus**
- Do **justice** to the people

**His Priority:**
- Extremely **quick in providing justice**
- Making sure people didn't get bothered by:
  - National calamity
  - Wars
  - Battles
  - Things like that

---

## The Historian's View

### What Can and Cannot Be Questioned

**The Assessment:**
> "There is one historian who has said: You can **question** whether Shivaji was the **greatest general** who waged battles and conquered new areas and stuff like that - but that you can question. But you can **never question** his **administrative apparatus and skills**."

**The Verdict:**
- One of the **best administrators**
- Provided the **best governance**

---

## The Eight Ministers

### Where the Money Went

**When Shivaji Was Anointed as King (Chhatrapati):**
- Had **eight ministers**

**The Highest Salary:**
- Given to the **home minister**
- Who was supposed to provide:
  - Administration
  - Conveniences
  - Those kinds of things to the **citizenry**

**NOT the Top General:**
- Guy who waged wars
- Conquered new areas
- His salary was **NOT the maximum**

**Why:**
> "The guy who provided **governance**, his salary was the **maximum**. Shivaji **valued that more than anything else**."

### The Governance Lesson

**Siraj ud-Daula:**
- **Terrible governance**
- Ruled on **whims**
- No regard for people

**Result:**
> "People so angry, they'd rather have **foreign invaders** than their own Nawab."

**Shivaji:**
- **Best governance**

---

### The Stone Metaphor

**Clive's Realization:**
> "If every villager threw one stone, we'd all be dead."

**But They Didn't:**

- Than they **feared foreigners**

- Now have to deal with **three powers**:
  1. Afghans (north)
  2. Nizam (south)  
  3. **British (east)**

---

**1757: The year everything changed. While Marathas and Afghans drew first blood in Punjab, the British made their move in Bengal. Siraj ud-Daula was so hated—governed so badly, taxed so harshly, ruled so whimsically—that people wanted anybody but him. Robert Clive came with barely 2-3 thousand troops. Bribed Siraj's commanders Mir Jafar and Raja Durlabh. They stayed neutral or fled. The much larger army defeated. Siraj fled, captured, killed. British made Mir Jafar puppet Nawab. Real power: British. For namesake only: Mir Jafar. Victory parade through Plassey. Clive realized: thousands of villagers watching. Could kill us all if each threw one stone. But they didn't. Why? Because they hated Siraj more than they feared foreigners. When governance is that bad, people accept anyone. Peshwa wanted Bengal. Too slow. British got there first. While Marathas and Afghans exhaust each other in battle of attrition, British establish foothold in most prosperous province. Disciplined army, political savvy, puppet strategy, perfect timing. The contrast: Siraj—worst governance, hated by his people. Shivaji—best governance, loved by his people, paid home minister more than top general because citizen welfare came first. The lesson: governance matters more than identity. The reality: British now have Bengal. Marathas lost it before they could move. The future: British get stronger while Marathas and Afghans fight. The beginning of the end started in a small village called Plassey.**
