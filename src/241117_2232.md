# Raghoba Bharari: The Grand Campaign That Bankrupted the Empire (1758)
## The Weather Problem, The Money Problem, & The Day Everything Collapsed

---

## The Name of the Campaign

### "Raghoba Bharari"

**What It Means:**
- **Raghoba** = Raghunath Rao (nickname: "Raghoba Dada")
- **Bharari** = When a **bird of prey makes a big leap/flight**

**Why This Name:**
- Raghunath Rao went **all the way to Attock**
- Further than Marathas had **ever gone**
- Like a massive leap
- Campaign to the **northwest corner of India**

**The Symbolism:**
- Maratha Kingdom started with **Shivaji** - just **three districts**
- Slowly grew drastically
- Now **thousands of Maratha soldiers in Attock**
- Something **tremendous**

**The Legacy:**
- Raghobadada is **credited** with this tremendous victory
- His **pinnacle/high point** of career
- Had **never been done**, never done **again**

**The Irony:**
> "He also caused a lot of troubles later on, but let's not get into that."

## The Nephew Gets Peshawar

### Abdur Rahman's Reward

**What Raghunath Rao Did:**
- Gave Abdali's nephew **Subhedarship of Peshawar**
- The nephew who came to defect from his uncle

**Raghunath Rao's Plan:**
- Stayed in Lahore for about **one month only**
- Didn't want to stay longer
- Gave **Adina Beg** the title of **Subedar of Punjab**
- Appointed **Mughal officers under him**

**The Deal:**
- Every year Adina Beg promised:
- Send tribute of **75 lakh rupees**

---

## The Sikh Problem

### Why Raghunath Rao Used a Proxy

**The Rising Sikhs:**
- Sikhs were **rising in Punjab**
- Had several groups (no central command yet)
- Working toward same goal: **bringing their own power in Punjab**

**Raghunath Rao's Understanding:**
- Guessed it wouldn't be **easy to control Punjab**
- Didn't want to control it **first-hand**
- That would **pit Marathas against Sikhs**

**The Religious Connection:**
- Sikhs considered same/similar to Hindus at the time
- Sikhism and Hinduism **not that different** in Punjab then
- Sikhs were more **militant**
- But **smaller** compared to Hindu majority

**The Pattern:**
- In Hindu households, **elders would become Sikh**
- Because Sikhs were more militant
- They would do **warfare**

**The Strategy:**
> "Raghunath Rao didn't want to take the fight with the Sikhs. He understood that they are on the ascendancy."

**The Solution:**
- Let **Adina Beg be Subedar**
- As long as he pays tribute (it was **all about money**)
- Adina Beg will be the **face of Mughal power**
- But left behind **small chunk of Maratha army** for maintenance

---

## The Disillusionment

### Why Punjabis Hated Marathas

**The Reception:**
- **Disappointment** with Marathas
- Didn't look upon them **positively**
- **Disillusionment**

**Why:**
1. **Total foreigners** - didn't speak the language
2. **Only concern: tribute and money**
3. **Same as Abdali's goals** - just money, not governance
4. **No intention to settle down** or govern long-term

**The Equivalence:**
> "Both Abdali and Marathas, basically their goals were the same: tribute, money."

---

## The Climate Problem

### Why Marathas Couldn't Stay

**VERY IMPORTANT POINT:**

**The Weather Pattern:**
- Punjab weather **different than what they were used to**
- In the Khan (Deccan), weather is **much warmer**
- As you go north, becomes **fairly cold**
- Marathas **not used to cold weather**
- Especially winter - **four months of cold**

**Why This Matters:**
> "This also has importance to the **Panipat battle** as well."

**The Geography:**
- **Panipat** is as **north** as Punjab towns/cities
- Today Panipat is in **Haryana state** (adjacent to Punjab)
- Weather pattern **exactly the same**
- Weather can be **very cold during winter**
- **Marathas not used to that weather**

**Translation:** The weather will be a factor at Panipat. ❄️

---

## The River Problem

### The Five Rivers & Monsoon Season

**The Challenge:**
- After monsoon begins (**mid-June**)
- For about **four months during monsoon**
- **Difficult to cross rivers**

**Punjab's Geography:**
- **Five rivers** including Sindhu
- All five/four rivers **dump into Sindhu**
- Carries on toward **Arabian Ocean**
- Have to cross these **five rivers** coming from Afghanistan
- **Big obstacle**

**The Reality:**
- **No bridges** at that time
- Crossing rivers = **major problem**
- Especially with large army

---

## The Financial Impossibility

### Why They Had to Leave

**The Economic Reality:**
> "To keep a large Maratha army in Punjab was **not economically possible** for Maratha or Peshwa."

**The Question:** How to sustain them?
- Pay their **salaries**
- Provide **supplies**
- All the **logistics**

**Not possible** due to monetary situation.

---

## The Letter to Pune

### Raghunath Rao's Report

**What He Wrote:**
- Told Peshwa all he had done in northern campaign
- The great success he had

**The Wise Decision:**
- Decided to **come back**
- Would be in **deeper hole financially** if stayed longer

**The Problem:**
- Peshwa sitting in Pune
- **Not swayed** by military glory
- Peshwa = **very good politician**
- Understood the great success
- But in his eyes: **success = financial success**

**The Question:**
> "What did Raghoba/Raghunath Rao bring back?"

**If money is lacking:** What good is the rest of the accomplishment?

---

## The Borrowed Money

### How the Campaign Was Funded

**The Reality:**
- To fund Raghunath Rao's northern campaign
- Peshwa **collected lots of money from moneylenders**
- At some point: **have to return the money**
- At least as much as you borrowed

**The Consequence:**
> "If you can't do that, then you go into **deeper hole** as a Maratha Empire. Nobody likes it."

---

## The Disaster: Raghunath Rao Came Back in DEBT

### The Financial Catastrophe

**What Happened:**
- When Raghunath Rao came back
- He was **in debt - big time**
- Peshwa was **NOT impressed at all**

**The Relationship:**
- Raghunath Rao = Nana Saheb's **younger brother**
- Took it **personally**

**The Expectation vs Reality:**
- Expectation: **Surplus money** for Marathas to grow
- Reality: **Deeper hole** than before
- Whatever he borrowed to go north
- **Didn't even bring back that much money**

**Critical Point:** This is why Peshwa wasn't happy despite the military success.

---

## The Temple Visit: Kashi

### The Holy City

**What Happened:**
- Peshwa himself came to **Kashi (Varanasi)** before this
- Took a holy dip in the **Ganga**

**Why Kashi:**
- One of **holiest Hindu cities**
- City of **Lord Shankar** (Shiva)
- Very important pilgrimage site

**Location:** Kashi/Varanasi on the **Ganga River**

---

## The Burning Ghats

### Manikarnika Ghat

**What Shankar Represents:**
- **The Destroyer** (in the Hindu trinity)
- Creator, Sustainer, **Destroyer**

**Where Shankar "Lives":**
- **Manikarnika Ghat** in Kashi
- The ghat where **bodies are burned**

**What You See:**
- Ghat **full of burning pyres**
- Dead bodies brought there
- Being burned constantly
- **Lots and lots of fires**

**Why:**
> "Shankar is the destroyer. He doesn't mind roaming around these ghastly sites where bodies are being burned. That's where he lives or wanders."

**The Uniqueness:**
- You don't see this with other gods
- Shankar is comfortable with death and cremation
- Makes sense: he's the destroyer

---

## The Letter to Holkar-Shinde

### The Orders

**What Peshwa Wrote:**
- Ordered **Shinde-Holkar** to finish the job in north
- Continue what Raghunath Rao started
- Complete the conquest

**The Confidence:**
> "Once the order goes to Shinde-Holkar, **it's as good as the job is done**. I have no worries."

**Translation:** These guys will get it done. Peshwa has full faith.

---

## The Same Day Disaster

### Adina Beg's Death

**The Timing:**
> "The day Mr. Raghunath Rao landed in Pune, on the **same day**, Adina Beg was **dead** in Lahore."

**How:** Assassinated? [Details to come]

**The Setback:**
- This is **BAD**
- Raghunath Rao had dealt with Adina Beg
- Had agreements with him (75 lakh tribute, etc.)
- **But he's dead**

**The Consequence:**
> "Now this is tough. What to do? It will create instability and restlessness."

**The Collapse:**
- Whatever arrangements Raghunath Rao put in place
- Now they look like **they will collapse**

---

## The Son-in-Law Fails

### Khwaja Can't Hold Punjab

**Who Took Over:**
- **Khwaja [somebody]**
- Adina Beg's **son-in-law** (zawai)

**The Problem:**
- **Not able to defeat Afghan revolt** in Punjab
- Afghans hadn't forgotten about Punjab
- Punjab = **lots of taxes and revenue**
- Afghan tribes probably had **blessings of Abdali**
- They were **revolting**

**The Result:**
- Khwaja couldn't defeat these Afghan tribes
- They won out over him
- Created **instability**

---

## Sabaji Shinde Steps In

### Holding the Line (Barely)

**Who Was Left Behind:**
- **Sabaji Shinde** was left with some force by Raghunath Rao

**What He Did:**
- Somehow **controlled the Afghan tribal revolt** in Punjab
- Took control of **Peshawar**
- Essentially **in charge** now

**Not Official:**
- Not declared Subedar (would create trouble with locals)
- They wouldn't like it (he's an **outright foreigner**)
- But he had **practical control**
- Because of him, there was **stability**

---

## The Pattern Continues

### The Moment He Left

**What Happened:**
- Sabaji Shinde stepped out of Punjab (maybe went to Delhi)
- Afghan tribes that had **quieted down**
- **Surged back up again**

**The Realization:**
> "Now it became clear that it was **difficult to maintain superiority** or total control over these Afghan tribes for Sabaji Shinde because he was **far away from his power base** (Deccan)."

**The Force:**
- Probably left with **7,000-10,000 horse**
- **Not enough**

---

## The Hegemony

### How Far Maratha Influence Went

**Peshwa's Hegemony:**
- Up to **Attock** (on Sindhu River)
- As far north as Marathas had **ever gone**
- Sabaji still able to maintain **tenuous control**

**Who Was Sabaji Shinde:**
- Brother of **Jayapa Shinde** (deceased, killed during siege)
- Also brother of **Dattaji Shinde**
- One of **five Shinde brothers**
- **Younger brother** even

**The Division:**
- **Sabaji Shinde** based in Punjab
- **Dattaji Shinde** based in Delhi
- **Dattaji now in charge** of northern army

---

## The Mughal Emperor: Powerless

### Reduced to Red Fort

**The Reality:**
- Mughal Emperor = **namesake only**
- **No power** to appoint Subedars or officers
- Totally reduced to **within the walls of Red Fort**

**Attock = New Boundary:**
- Attock became the boundary in the north
- Of Maratha "empire" (loose term)
- Far north, on **border with Afghanistan**
- **Tremendous achievement**

---

## The Debt Problem (Revisited)

### The 80 Lakh Increase

**The Numbers:**
- Raghunath Rao went on northern campaign
- **Huge loan** sought from moneylenders
- Both **Malhar Rao Holkar** and **Raghunath Rao**

**When They Came Back:**
- That huge loan was **still intact** (almost)
- New ground was covered (went to Afghanistan)
- But **Nana Saheb Peshwa heavily in debt**

**The Increase:**
- There was an **addition of 80 lakh rupees**
- The debt **even increased in size**

**Over Budget:** They were 80 lakh rupees MORE in debt.

---

## Nana Saheb: The Financial Manager

### The Man Who Cared About Money

**His Strengths:**
- Could go to battle
- But **more interested in**: governance, administration, **finances**

**His Reaction:**
- **Didn't like it at all**
- Fact that they were going **deeper into debt**
- **Over budget** by 80 lakh rupees
- On top of what they'd already sought

**The Situation:**
- Raghunath Rao has returned
- But **new trouble is brewing**
- Shinde brothers left in north to **figure it out**

**In Punjab:**
- Sabaji Shinde somehow keeping it together (barely)

**In Delhi:**
- Dattaji **overall in charge** of northern frontiers
- But based in Delhi

## Geographic Context

**The Weather Problem:**
- **Punjab/Haryana** = cold in winter (4 months)
- **Panipat** = in Haryana, same cold weather
- **Deccan/Khan** = much warmer
- **Marathas not used to cold**

**The River Problem:**
- **Five rivers** in Punjab
- **No bridges**
- **Monsoon season** = even harder to cross

**The Distance Problem:**
- **1,000+ miles** from Deccan to Punjab
- Power base = Deccan
- Too far to maintain effectively

---

## Key Themes

### 1. **The Name Says It All**
- "Bharari" = great leap of a bird of prey
- Never done before, never done again
- Raghobadada's pinnacle

### 2. **The Weather Will Matter**
- Cold winter = problem for Marathas
- **Important for Panipat battle**
- They're not prepared for it

### 3. **Financial Disaster**
- Military glory ≠ financial success
- Came back **deeper in debt**
- Nana Saheb NOT impressed
- 80 lakh MORE in debt

### 4. **Proxy Leadership Failed**
- Adina Beg died immediately
- Son-in-law couldn't handle it
- Afghan revolts resumed
- Arrangements collapsed

### 5. **The Sikh Factor**
- Raghunath Rao wisely avoided fighting them
- They were rising
- Used Adina Beg as buffer
- But that buffer is now gone

### 6. **Sabaji's Impossible Task**
- Left with insufficient force
- Far from power base
- Moment he leaves, revolts resume
- Tenuous control at best

### 7. **Same Goals as Abdali**
- Marathas also just wanted money/tribute
- Didn't want to settle or govern
- Punjabis **disillusioned** with both
- No difference between invaders

---

## Critical Insights

### Why the Campaign Failed Financially

**The Math:**
1. Borrowed huge loans from moneylenders
2. Went to Punjab, reached Attock/Peshawar
3. Didn't bring back enough to repay
4. Actually increased debt by 80 lakh
5. Nana Saheb expected surplus, got deficit

**The Expectation:**
- Military success → capture territory → collect tribute → repay loans + profit

**The Reality:**
- Military success → weak administration → can't hold territory → can't collect sustained tribute → still owe money + MORE debt

---

### The Adina Beg Timing

**The Coincidence:**
- Same day Raghunath Rao lands in Pune
- Adina Beg dies in Lahore

**What This Means:**
- All arrangements immediately vulnerable
- No strong local leader to maintain order
- Afghan revolts resurge
- Everything Raghunath Rao set up = collapsing

**The Metaphor:**
- Built a house of cards
- Strong wind (Adina Beg's death) knocked it down
- Before Raghunath Rao even got home

---

### The Shinde Brothers' Burden

**Five Brothers:**
1. **Jayapa Shinde** - dead (killed in siege)
2. **Dattaji Shinde** - Delhi, northern command
3. **Sabaji Shinde** - Punjab, barely holding
4. Two others - not mentioned yet

**The Impossible:**
- Hold Punjab with insufficient force
- Far from home base
- Afghan revolts constant
- No financial support
- Climate hostile
- Rivers blocking retreat

**They're being asked to hold something that can't be held.**

---

### The Climate Foreshadowing

**Why This Matters:**
> "This also has importance to the Panipat battle."

**The Setup:**
- Marathas not used to cold
- Punjab cold = Panipat cold (Haryana)
- Four months of winter
- Will be fighting in that weather eventually
- They don't know how to handle it

**The Omen:** Their inability to stay in Punjab due to weather = foreshadowing their problems at Panipat.

---

## Foreshadowing

### What's Coming

**The Financial Crisis:**
- 80 lakh MORE in debt
- Nana Saheb unhappy
- Brothers expected to fix it
- But how? With what money?

**The Military Crisis:**
- Sabaji barely holding Punjab
- Dattaji managing Delhi politics
- Insufficient forces
- Adina Beg dead
- Afghan revolts ongoing
- Abdali will return

**The Weather Crisis:**
- Can't stay in Punjab long-term
- Cold winters unbearable
- But they've committed to holding the north
- What happens when winter comes at Panipat?

**The Inevitable:**
> "Now things are coming into picture. Hopefully in a couple of pages we'll get into the real story. We'll see how it shakes out."

---

**1758: "Raghoba Bharari" - the great leap to Attock and Peshawar. A name for the ages, a campaign that goes further than any Maratha ever went. Rose water and lights and memorials and glory. But underneath? A financial disaster. Came back 80 lakh rupees deeper in debt than when he left. Nana Saheb is pissed. His younger brother made promises and arrangements with Adina Beg, but the day Raghunath Rao lands in Pune, Adina Beg dies in Lahore. Everything collapses. Afghan revolts surge back. Sabaji Shinde left behind with insufficient force, barely holding on, far from home in the cold that Marathas can't handle. The moment he leaves an area, revolts resume. It's tenuous. It's unsustainable. It's expensive. The Punjabis hate the Marathas as much as they hated Abdali - same goals, just tribute and money, no real governance. The great campaign's legacy: massive debt, weak administration, hostile climate, and a false sense of achievement. The bird of prey made its great leap. But it couldn't stay in the air. Now it's falling.**
