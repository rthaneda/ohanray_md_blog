## The Eyewitness Account: Horror at the Yamuna

### The Quote (Post-Massacre)

**What the Witness Saw:**

> "When I arrived at the banks of Yamuna River, I realized I can cross the Yamuna River to the other bank. The river water that was polluted by blood was looking with a yellow tinge."

**The Timeline of Blood:**
- **First week:** River water turned **completely red**
- **Second week:** Developed a **yellow tinge**
- Blood pollution so severe it changed the river color
- Visible evidence of the massacre scale

---

## The Destruction: Complete Devastation

### What Was Lost

**Material Destruction:**
- **Everything Abdali destroyed**
- All possessions looted
- Nothing left intact
- Total wipeout

**Spiritual Destruction:**
- **Temples totally defiled**
- **Holy places desecrated**
- Sanctity destroyed
- Prestige annihilated
- Cultural heritage violated

**The Warning:**

> "If we allow these kind of tribes to come into India, then the wealth, women and any civilization will not be intact. It will be all destroyed."

---

## The Historical Parallel: Nadir Shah Redux

### The 1739 Comparison

**Nadir Shah's Invasion (1739):**
- **Brought Abdali** as his soldier
- Did similar destruction
- Massive looting
- Civilian massacres

**Abdali's 1757:**
- **Same level of destruction** as Nadir Shah
- Following his mentor's playbook
- Potentially even worse
- The student became the master

---

## The Failure of Protection

### Nobody Came to Help

**The Local Kings & Royals:**
- **Didn't come to rescue**
- **Stayed hidden in forts**
- Protective sanctuaries
- **Just saving their own lives**
- Too scared to act

**The Military Failure:**
- **Marathas** couldn't stop it
- **Jats** couldn't stop it
- **Nara Samvar** = massacre of humans
- Insufficient forces
- Unprepared

**What Saved Them:**

1. **Cholera epidemic** struck Abdali's camp
   - Soldiers **dying like insects**
   - Divine curse (according to survivors)
   
2. **Summer heat**
   - **Pathans couldn't bear Indian summer**
   - Afghanistan is cold, India is hot
   - Heat drove them out
   - Natural defense

---

## The Pathan Identity

### Who Are Pathans?

**Definition:**
- **Afghan tribe** (prominent one)
- Abdali was part of a Pathan tribe
- **Several sub-tribes** within Pathan
- Collectively called "Pathan"

**Why They Couldn't Stay:**
- Accustomed to **cold Afghan climate**
- **Indian summer = unbearable**
- Would have stayed longer otherwise
- Heat was India's defensive advantage

---

## The Inevitable Return

### The Fear

**The Reality:**
> "Now Abdali has left. But there is no telling when he can come back. It's probably that he will come back. It's just a matter of time."

**The Question:**
- **Which force in India** will take up fight with Abdali?
- **Is there a protector?**
- Who can save India from these **savage barbarians**?

---

## The Border: Attaq Fort

### The Boundary Town

**Location:**
- **West and north of Lahore**
- Town on the **boundary** between India and Afghanistan
- Strategic fort at Attaq

**Historical Control:**
- **During Aurangzeb's time:** Controlled by Mughals
- Had proper Subedar there
- Secure border

**Current Status (1757-1758):**
- **Very contested**
- **Going back and forth** in control
- Abdali getting stronger
- Mughals getting weaker
- **Out of Mughal control**
- **Out of Maratha control**
- **In flux**
- Getting under Abdali's control

---

## The Shrinking Empire (September 1757/1758)

### Raja Kishwarath's Letter to Nanasaheb

**What He Wrote:**

**Past Territory:**
- **Attaq** was part of Indian territory
- Under Aurangzeb or Marathas
- Secure boundary

**Current Territory (Lost):**
> "Attaq, west: Multan, Kabul. East: Bengal, Ayodhya, Prayag, Rohilkhand."

**New Reality:**
- **Attaq is gone** (lost to Abdali)
- Can only control from **Multan eastward**
  - Multan (much east and south of Attaq)
  - Everything going eastward
  - To Ayodhya
  - To Bengal (far east)

**The Conclusion:**
- Mughal Empire has **shrunk drastically**
- Major territory loss
- Border pushed far back

**His Response:**

> "Why should we be worried? The Mughals are so downtrodden anyway."

- Not worried about Mughals
- But what about Abdali?
- Bigger threat ignored

---

## Flashback: 1756 Campaign Planning

### The Rajput Tribute Collection

**The Plan:**
- **1756** - Peshwa decided campaign in North
- Goal: **Collect tribute from Rajputs**
- Going back two years before 1757 invasion

**The Backstory - How Tributes Began:**

1. **Shinde and Holkar helped Rajputs**
   - In succession battles (brothers fighting for power after father's death)
   
2. **Desperate deals were made**
   - Rajputs **under duress**
   - Agreed to **whatever terms**
   - "Give us X amount per year"
   - "In 10 years we'll pay everything we agreed to"
   
3. **After coming to power:**
   - Realized it's **impossible** to pay
   - Didn't have the **tax base**
   - Didn't have **capacity**
   - **Bad deals** to begin with
   
4. **Started backtracking**
   - Within 1-2 years
   - Couldn't keep paying
   - Broke agreements

**Why Peshwa Needed the Money:**
- **Constantly in need of funds**
- **Cannot conquer North India without money**
- Army salaries needed
- New equipment required
- Horses, supplies, etc.
- **Resources for money were limited**

**The Only Option:**
- Go back and **insist on tributes** that were agreed to
- Force collection
- Needed for campaigns

---

## Raghunath Rao's Fatal Mistake

### The Failure to Hold Territory

**What He Did Wrong:**

> "Raghunath Rao didn't think about a permanent force in Punjab or in Delhi or all the way to the northwest."

**What He Should Have Done:**
- **Keep strong Maratha force** in conquered areas
- Create **administration**
- Establish **government**
- Maintain **law and order**
- **Like Shivaji did**

**Shivaji's Method:**
- Whichever areas he conquered
- **Created system immediately**
- Administration in place
- Government functioning
- **Wouldn't be left in chaos**

**Raghunath Rao's Failure:**
- No permanent presence
- Only X number of forces (insufficient)
- Gave **Abdali easy way to reconquer**
- Could have held the territory
- But didn't establish proper control

---

## The Distance Problem

### Pune to Punjab

**The Geography:**
- **Thousands of kilometers/miles** away
- From Pune (home base) to Punjab
- Huge distance to maintain
- Even **communication** difficult
- Leadership nearly impossible

**The Result:**
- Had **some stations**
- But **woefully short of resources**
- Insufficient personnel
- No proper system
- Not sustainable

**The Lesson:**
- Can't control territory from that far
- Must have local administration
- Must have permanent forces
- Distance defeats empire-building

---

## The Delhi Complexity (1756-1757)

### Beyond Just Collecting Tribute

**The Situation Was More Complex:**
- Not just about getting money from Rajputs
- **Delhi was in chaos**

**The Power Struggle:**

| Person | Position | Goal |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Mughal Emperor** | Weak ruler | Powerless |
| **Current Wazir** | In position | "I'm not going anywhere" |
| **Najib Khan** | Rohilla leader | Wanted to be Wazir |
| **Shuja-ud-Daulah** | Awadh Nawab (Safdar Jung's son) | Wanted to be Wazir (father had been) |

**The Prestige:**
- Being **Wazir of Mughal Empire** = great thing
- Huge prestige
- Almost like being king
- Everyone wanted it

**The Result:**
- **Lot of tussle** between power centers
- **Nobody to control anything**
- Everyone weak
- **Basically chaos**
- **Anarchy**
- Constant complexity

---

## Why Marathas Had to Step In

### The Rohilla Insufficiency

**Najib Khan's Forces:**
- Had probably **5,000-15,000 Rohillas**
- **Woefully short** to establish order
- Could say "listen to me"
- Could say "I'll set up order"
- **But couldn't actually do it**
- Insufficient strength

**The Vacuum:**
- Somebody had to create order
- **Only party that potentially could:** Marathas
- They had the strength
- They had the organization
- Natural candidates

**The Three Problems:**

1. **Money shortage for Peshwa** (constant)
2. **Delhi totally unstable** (chaos)
3. **Abdali question** (will return anytime)

**Abdali's Status:**
- Not a **24/7 issue**
- Would **suddenly come**
- Stay **3-4 months**
- Get what he could
- **Then leave**
- Intermittent problem

**The Constant Problems:**
- Peshwa's money needs
- Delhi's instability
- Mughal emperor weak
- Too many power centers

---

## The Second Campaign North (1756)

### Sending Raghunath Rao Again

**The Decision:**

> "So then once again, Mr. Peshwa decided to send his younger brother to the north."

- **"Once again"** = had already come back once
- But circumstances required return
- Sent Raghunath Rao north again

---

## The Fighting Season: Post-Monsoon Tradition

### Why October?

**The Tradition:**
- New invasions begin **after monsoon**
- Monsoon ends by **October**
- "**Seema Ullanghan**" = Boundary crossing
- Tradition of starting campaigns then

**Two Critical Reasons:**

### Reason 1: Rivers Become Crossable

**During Monsoon:**
- Rivers **swell massively**
- Width of 100 meters → **becomes a mile wide**
- **Almost impossible to cross**
- Elephants, camels, horses can't cross
- No bridges
- Maybe small boats

**After Monsoon:**
- Water recedes
- Rivers crossable
- Army can move

### Reason 2: Farmers Become Available

**The Farming Calendar:**
- Farmers needed in monsoon
- Plant grains
- Do harvest
- Essential work

**Maratha Army Composition:**
- **60% were part-time fighters**
- Primarily farmers
- Needed for agriculture during monsoon

**After Harvest:**
- From October/November onward
- Until summer
- Farmers are **unemployed**
- "I don't have anything to do"
- "I can join for fighting"
- Available for campaigns

**The Logic:**
> "They might as well be fighting. Hey, I'm available."

---

## Seema Ullanghan: Boundary Crossing

### The Concept

**Definition:**
- **Seema** = boundary
- **Ullanghan** = cross
- **Together:** Cross the border into new territory

**The Tradition:**
- Around October/November
- After monsoon over
- **Ground is not wet anymore**
- Otherwise army gets **bogged down**

**The Strategy:**
- Cross your kingdom's boundary
- Go into **foreign territory**
- **Capture it by fighting**
- New battle season begins
- In enemy territory

---

## The October 1756 Plan

### Raghunath Rao's Departure

**The Decision:**
- Start from **Pune in October 1756**
- Standard timing
- After monsoon
- When farmers available
- When ground dry

**The Goals:**
1. Collect tributes from Rajputs
2. Stabilize Delhi
3. Establish Maratha presence
4. Create administration

---

## Geography

**The Border Zone:**
- **Attaq** - boundary fort (lost to Abdali)

- **Multan** - new boundary point (further east/south)

**The Empire:**
- **West boundary:** Moved from Attaq → Multan
- **East boundary:** Still reaches Bengal
- **Shrinkage:** Significant territory lost

**The Distance:**
- **Pune** (south) → **Punjab** (northwest) = thousands of km
- Too far to control effectively
- Communication difficult
- Leadership impossible

---

## Key Themes

1. **The Horror Witnessed** - Yamuna River red with blood
2. **Natural Defenses** - Cholera and summer heat
3. **Nobody Protected** - Local kings hid in forts
4. **The Inevitable Return** - Abdali will come back
5. **Border in Flux** - Attaq lost, empire shrinking
6. **The Tribute Problem** - Rajputs can't pay, Marathas need money
7. **Raghunath Rao's Error** - No permanent forces left behind
8. **The Distance Problem** - Can't control from Pune
9. **Delhi Chaos** - Multiple claimants, no order
10. **Seasonal Warfare** - Post-monsoon campaign tradition
11. **Part-Time Army** - 60% are farmers who join after harvest
12. **The Vacuum** - Only Marathas can fill it

---

## Critical Insights

### The Natural Defenses

**What Saved India:**
- **Not military strength** (failed)
- **Cholera epidemic** (divine intervention per survivors)
- **Summer heat** (Pathans couldn't handle it)

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't rely on these forever
- Abdali will come back
- Need actual military solution
- Natural defenses are temporary

### The Nadir Shah Pattern

**The Mentor-Student Relationship:**
- Nadir Shah (1739) brought Abdali as soldier
- Abdali learned from the master
- Now doing **same destruction**
- Same looting tactics
- Same brutality
- Potentially worse

**The Implication:**
- This is a **proven model**
- Worked for Nadir Shah
- Working for Abdali
- Will work again
- Need to break the cycle

### The Tribute Trap

**The Vicious Cycle:**

1. Rajputs desperate (succession crisis)
2. Promise huge tributes to Shinde/Holkar
3. Get help, win power
4. Realize tributes impossible to pay
5. Start backtracking
6. Marathas need the money
7. Have to force collection
8. Creates resentment
9. Weakens alliances

**The Problem:**
- Bad deals from the start
- Rajputs couldn't pay
- But Marathas needed money
- No good solution

### Raghunath Rao vs. Shivaji

**Shivaji's Model:**
- Conquer territory
- **Immediately create administration**
- Establish government
- Law and order systems
- **Leave it functional**
- Move to next conquest

**Raghunath Rao's Model:**
- Conquer territory
- Leave insufficient forces
- No administration
- No government
- **Leave it in chaos**
- Return to Pune

**The Result:**
- Shivaji's territories stayed conquered
- Raghunath Rao's territories lost again
- Abdali easily reconquered
- Fundamental strategic error

### The Wazir Musical Chairs

**Three People Want It:**
- Current Wazir (in position)
- Najib Khan (Rohilla, has local forces)
- Shuja-ud-Daulah (son of former Wazir)

**Why They Want It:**
- Huge **prestige**
- Almost like being king
- Real power (emperor is weak)

**Why It Matters:**
- Internal fighting weakens everyone
- Nobody can actually govern
- Everyone competing, nobody leading
- Creates the vacuum Marathas could fill

### The Part-Time Army Problem

**The Reality:**
- **60% of Maratha army** = farmers
- Only available after harvest
- Need to return for planting

**The Advantage:**
- Large army when needed
- Don't pay them year-round
- Cost-effective

**The Disadvantage:**
- **Seasonal warfare only**
- Can't campaign during monsoon
- Must finish before planting season
- Time-limited campaigns

**Why October Start:**
- Harvest done
- Farmers available
- Rivers crossable
- Ground dry
- Perfect timing

### The Distance Doom

**The Math:**
- Pune to Punjab = thousands of kilometers
- **Communication takes weeks**
- **Orders take weeks**
- **Reinforcements take months**

**The Impossibility:**
- Can't govern from that far
- Can't respond to crises
- Can't maintain control
- **Must have local presence**

**Raghunath Rao's Failure:**
- Understood the conquest
- Didn't understand the hold
- Won battles, lost territories
- Tactical success, strategic failure

---

## Foreshadowing

**What This Sets Up:**

1. **Raghunath Rao going north again** (Oct 1756)
2. **Without learning the lesson** (no permanent forces)
3. **Money still a problem** (need tributes)
4. **Delhi still chaos** (no order established)
5. **Abdali will return** (it's inevitable)
6. **Border shrinking** (Attaq lost, Multan next?)
7. **Marathas must fill vacuum** (only ones who can)

**The Questions:**
- Will Raghunath Rao establish permanent presence this time?
- Will he collect enough tribute?
- Will Delhi stabilize?
- When will Abdali return?
- Will Marathas be ready?

---

**1757-1758: The Yamuna runs yellow with blood, temples lie desecrated, and Abdali is gone - driven out by cholera and summer heat, not by any army. Nobody protected the people. The kings hid in their forts. The Marathas and Jats couldn't stop it. Only nature saved India this time. But everyone knows he'll be back. It's just a matter of when. Meanwhile, the Mughal Empire shrinks. Attaq is lost. The border moves east to Multan. Delhi is chaos - three men fight to be Wazir while the emperor is powerless. Raghunath Rao is being sent north again in October 1756, after the monsoon, when the farmers are available and the ground is dry. But will he learn from his mistake? Will he leave permanent forces this time? Or will he conquer and abandon again, leaving the door open for Abdali's inevitable return?**
