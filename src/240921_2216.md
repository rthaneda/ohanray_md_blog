## The Balu Jat Incident

---

- BUT had **no idea about morals or moral standards** (niti)
- Very bright guy
- Didn't follow any due process
- Had **no moral standing**

**His Philosophy:**

### The Immediate Betrayal

---

## Abdali Returns: 1753

### The Demand

**What Happened:**
- As soon as **1753** came
- Abdali asked for his **yearly collection of 50 lakh rupees**
- Sent demand to the Emperor
- It was a **big sum**

### Context: What Marathas Were Getting

**The Comparison:**
- Marathas were getting paid **50 lakh rupees** (from the treaty)
- Abdali wanted the **same amount**
- Already a huge amount

---

## The Treaty Gets Invoked

### Safdar Jung Calls in the Marathas

**What He Did:**
- Asked the Marathas to **help the Mughals out**
- This was their **Ahadnama** (the treaty agreement)
- Part of the agreement: if Abdali comes, help rebuff him or convince him to go away

---

## Understanding Abdali's Claim

### Was This Pre-Agreed?

**The Question:** Was this previously agreed upon?

**The Answer:**
- Remember they had agreed to pay him some money
- Especially **Mir Manu** had made such agreements
- But Mir Manu's initiative (not official emperor policy)

**The Reality:**
- Doesn't matter if it was official or not
- This was between the Emperor and Abdali
- **Marathas were bound** by their treaty regardless

---

## The Treaty's Terms Clarified

### What the Treaty Actually Said

**The Conditions:**
- NOT to vanquish Abdali in his own land
- ONLY if he **attacks** and starts doing "funny stuff" in Delhi
- Especially protect Delhi

### Why Delhi Mattered

**The History:**
- The kind of **atrocities** visited upon Delhi by:
  - Iranian Shah (Nadir Shah)
  - Abdali
- These guys were familiar with those horrors
- Didn't want it to happen again

### Why Punjab Mattered

**The Strategic Concern:**
- Punjab had **already slipped** from the Emperor's hands
- Mir Manu had **switched sides**
- Wanted to save Punjab as much as possible
- Not let it slip into **Afghan sphere of influence**
- That was another reason to invoke the treaty

### The Terms

**The Agreement:**
- Only if Abdali comes to Punjab or **eastwards**
- If he stays in Afghanistan without trouble → nobody cares
- If he moves east → Marathas must respond

---

## The Emperor's Response

### Appeasing Abdali

**What the Emperor Did:**
- Didn't totally reject what Abdali asked
- Gave something as a **token**
- Said: "This is it. We'll look at other things later"
- Basically **appeasing** Abdali

**The Amount:**
- Gave him **five lakhs for now**
- Said they'd raise the rest later
- Whether he wanted to give 50% or 10% of full sum → who knows

### Why He Did This

**The Calculation:**
- Hoping Marathas will save him
- Didn't want to pay the **full amount** for sure
- Maybe didn't have it in liquid cash at the time
- Seems like a big amount for the time

**The Real Fear:**
- Didn't want Abdali to come back to Delhi again
- If he descends on Delhi → feared that outcome
- Could be **catastrophic**
- Wanted to somehow not see Abdali anywhere close to Delhi

**The Math:**
- If Abdali came looting → would be **more costly** than 50 lakh rupees
- Better to pay some now, promise more later
- Keep him away

## Strategic Analysis

### Javed Khan's Fatal Mistake

**What He Did Wrong:**
1. **Rose too fast** - From low caste to Nawab Bahadur
2. **Made it obvious** - Public scandal with Udham Bai
3. **Appointed his own men** - Attempted coup was transparent
4. **Directly challenged** - Used Balu Jat against Safdar Jung's territory
5. **Insulted the wazir** - Expected salute, got ignored
6. **Underestimated opponent** - Didn't realize Safdar Jung would act decisively

**The Result:** Dead, body in the river, no ceremony

### Safdar Jung's Ruthless Efficiency

**What He Did Right:**
1. **Saw the threat** - Recognized coup attempt
2. **Acted decisively** - Dinner trap, clean execution
3. **Sent a message** - Head in street, body in river (public warning)
4. **Re-consolidated** - No opponents left afterwards
5. **Made emperor dependent** - Total control achieved

### The Imad ul-Mulk Problem

**Why This Is Dangerous:**
- Very smart but completely amoral
- No loyalty (betrayed his savior immediately)
- Wants absolute power
- Ruthless and efficient
- Already becoming "most merciless" commander
- At age 16, he's just getting started
- In 10 years, he'll be unstoppable

**The Irony:**
- Safdar Jung saved him
- Raised him as a son
- Gave him huge power
- **He immediately begins plotting against him**

---

## The Abdali Pressure (1753)

### Why This Matters

**The Situation:**
- Abdali demanding 50 lakh
- Emperor can't/won't pay in full
- Gives 5 lakh as token
- Calls in Marathas per treaty

**The Consequences:**
1. **Treaty gets tested** - Is it real or just paper?
2. **Marathas must respond** - Contractually obligated
3. **Abdali sees the game** - Knows Marathas are now the muscle
4. **Emperor plays both sides** - Appeases Abdali, uses Marathas
5. **Collision course confirmed** - Abdali vs. Marathas inevitable

### The Terms Reminder

**What Marathas Agreed To:**
- Defend against internal AND external enemies
- But ONLY if they threaten Delhi/Punjab area
- NOT to invade Afghanistan
- Reactive defense, not offensive war

**The Gray Area:**
- Is demanding money "attacking"?
- Is refusing to pay valid?
- Does "convince him to go away" mean pay him?
- Or does it mean fight him?

---

## The Court Dynamics

### The Power Structure (1753)

**Top Tier:**
1. **Safdar Jung** - Wazir, total power, no opponents
2. **Emperor** - Dependent on wazir, losing autonomy

**Rising Stars:**
1. **Imad ul-Mulk** - Mir Bakshi at 16, already plotting

**The Women Behind the Throne:**
1. **Udham Bai** - Queen Mother, dancing girl past, scandal-ridden

**Dead:**
1. **Javed Khan** - Executed for coup attempt
2. **Ghaziuddin** - Poisoned by stepmother

**External Threats:**
1. **Ahmad Shah Abdali** - Demanding payment

**Military Power:**
1. **Marathas** - Treaty-bound to protect Mughals

---

## Key Themes

1. **Low Caste Ambition** - Javed Khan's rise and fall shows dangers of rapid ascent
2. **Ruthless Efficiency** - Safdar Jung eliminates threats decisively
3. **Ungrateful Betrayal** - Imad ul-Mulk immediately plots against savior
4. **Court Scandals** - Dancing girls, nighttime meetings, public mockery
5. **The Poison Cup Returns** - Ghaziuddin's death still reverberating
6. **Abdali's Patience Ends** - 1753 marks his return to pressure
7. **Treaty Obligations** - Marathas now must deliver on promises
8. **The Emperor's Weakness** - Totally dependent, playing both sides

---

## The Foreshadowing

**What We Know Is Coming:**
- Imad ul-Mulk will become most merciless in 10 years
- He's already plotting against Safdar Jung NOW (at age 16)
- Abdali won't accept 5 lakh as final payment
- Marathas will have to respond
- Emperor can't protect himself
- More assassinations and murders coming
- "New low" not yet reached

---

## The Ironies

**Irony #1:**
- Safdar Jung saves Imad ul-Mulk's life
- Makes him powerful
- He immediately betrays him
- This act of kindness will destroy him

**Irony #2:**
- Javed Khan rose through scandal with dancing girl
- Died at a dinner (like Ghaziuddin)
- The meal is the weapon

**Irony #3:**
- Emperor thought he was clever playing both sides
- Now totally dependent on wazir
- Lost all autonomy

**Irony #4:**
- Marathas signed treaty to get money and power
- Now obligated to fight Abdali
- The payment comes due

---

**1753: The year the bill comes due. Abdali is calling. The Marathas must answer. And inside the court, a 16-year-old sociopath is plotting his next move...**
