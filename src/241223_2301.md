### Explaining His Difficulties

**About End of January 1760:**
- Malhar Rao writes **long letter** to Peshwa
- Explaining difficulties in reaching Dattaji

### The Timeline From Holkar's Perspective

**First Message:**
> "I received Jankoji's letter that he was going to invade the Gilcha [Afghans] and I should come quickly to his aid."

**His Response:**
- Left Jaipur
- Sent away his **heavy guns**

**The Problem:**
- **Ruffians rose in revolts**
- (This was actually thanks to **Abdali instructing Madho Singh**)

**Second Message:**
> "From Jankoji's second letter it appeared the threat of Abdali had abated and he was fighting Najib Khan."

**So:**
- It seemed like Jankoji fighting Najib
- Which they were

**What Holkar Did:**
> "I had to return to suppress the ruffians, presumably in Jaipur, and had to teach them a lesson at Balwara."

- Had to deal with revolts
- Didn't know it was **Abdali's political maneuvering**
- Madho Singh keeping him busy

**December 28, 1759:**
> "I received a letter from Jankoji Shinde urging me to hurry, saying he has crossed the Yamuna near Kunjpura and is facing the Gilcha."

**January 3, 1760:**
> "I left on 3rd of January 1760, disposed of my heavy guns and moved out."

**What He Found:**
> "The Gilcha came to Thanesar and there was a battle near Budhiya. At night the Gilcha crossed the Yamuna and went into the Doab. Shuja is on his border. Najib Khan at Shukratal. Madho Singh has cooled down due to my efforts. Abdali has been called here by Najib Khan and Madho Singh."

- So he's explaining all this to Peshwa
- The political situation
- Who called Abdali
- Where everyone is positioned

## Abdali Enters Delhi

### The Appointment

**Meanwhile:**
- Abdali moved to **Delhi**

**What He Did:**
- Appointed his **vizier Shah Wali Khan's cousin**
- **Yakub Ali Khan**
- As **governor of Delhi**

**The Significance:**
- His own vizier
- Vizier's cousin
- They were able to just **reach the capital**

---

## Why Didn't They Defend Delhi?

### The Question

**The Confusion:**
- Whole point to **defend Delhi**
- Why camped out on river?
- When Abdali just **walked into Delhi**?

### The Explanation

**The Problem:**
- Not sure how to proceed
- **Abdali's reputation** had grown over time
- Extremely difficult opponent
- Holkar was there
- But Holkar **in action**

**Holkar's Reluctance:**
- Did not want to take on Abdali
- With **insufficient troops**
- With **insufficient army**

**The Strategic Reason:**
- Holkar was **old-fashioned commander**
- Would also maybe **suffer same fate** (as Dattaji)
- Saw what it did to Dattaji
- **Had to think** before sacrificing army

**His Fighting Style:**
- Plus never believed in **frontal attacks**
- Believed in **surgical strikes**
- That kind of stuff
- Not comfortable with **one-on-one frontal attacks**
- **Win or lose** situation
- Didn't believe in that

### The Age Factor

**The Reality:**
- Holkar was **older gentleman**
- Little bit older
- Abdali by this time like **30 years old**
- Holkar in his **50s**
- Wasn't ready to take on Abdali one-on-one

## Critical Insights

### The Iconic Last Words

**Why It Matters:**
> "Bachenge to aur bhi ladenge" (If I survive, I will fight even more)

**The Cultural Impact:**
- Known across India today
- Instantly recognizable
- Symbol of defiance
- Spirit unbroken even in death

**What It Represents:**
- Maratha **fighting spirit**
- **Never surrender** mentality
- Courage in face of certain death
- Defiant to the last

**The Irony:**
- He was **right about his death**
- "If I survive" = knew he wouldn't
- But **wrong about underestimating Abdali**
- That underestimation = why he's dying
- The courage was there
- The judgment was not

### Qutub Shah: The Ideological Warrior

**Who He Really Was:**
- Not just any commander
- **Najib's teacher**
- **Jihadi teacher** specifically
- Propaganda specialist

**Why This Matters:**
- This wasn't just military
- It was **ideological warfare**
- Religious dimension
- Not just conquest = conversion/destruction

**The Beheading:**
- Presenting head to Najib → Abdali
- Trophy of war
- Symbol of victory
- Demoralization tactic
- Sends message: **This is what happens**

### The 20,000 Who Didn't Fight

**The Stunning Detail:**
> "The entire Shinde army of 20,000 demoralized men did not participate in the fight at Burari Ghat."

**What This Means:**
- Only **Dattaji's 5,000** actually fought
- **20,000 others** just watched
- After leader fell = fled
- **No discipline**
- **No backup plan**
- **No command structure** without Dattaji

**The Implication:**
- If those 20,000 had fought
- Could have **overwhelmed** enemy
- But **morale broke** instantly
- Loss of leader = total collapse
- **Psychological defeat**

### The Dense Grass Detail

**Hingani's Report:**
> "The dense grass on the Yamuna made things difficult."

**Why This Matters:**
- **Visibility** problem
- Can't see enemy formations
- Can't coordinate movements
- Perfect for **ambush**
- Dattaji charged in blind

**The Tactical Error:**
- Attacking in terrain that **favors defenders**
- Can't use cavalry effectively
- Can't see where going
- Plays to Afghan strengths (ambush, missile fire)

### The Chase: 40 Miles

**The Pursuit:**
- Marathas ran **140 miles total**
- Afghans chased for **40 miles**
- That's **significant pursuit**

**What It Shows:**
- Afghans wanted to **maximize damage**
- Not just winning = **destroying**
- Kill as many as possible
- Capture baggage and treasure
- **Total route**, not just victory

**The Cost:**
- Lost **horses, treasure, dignity**
- Half-naked when arrived
- **Psychological devastation**
- Not just military defeat

### Holkar's Excuses

**The Letter:**
- Very detailed explanation
- Why he was late
- All the obstacles

**The Reality:**
- Some legitimate (ruffians = Madho Singh's work)
- Some questionable (second letter saying threat abated)
- **Disposed of heavy guns** = big mistake
- Could have used those

**The Pattern:**
- Always an excuse
- Never quite commits
- Surgical strikes, not frontal battles
- **Self-preservation** > victory

**The Age Issue:**
- He's in his **50s**
- Abdali is **30**
- Not prime fighting age
- **Tired commander**
- Old tactics, old body

### The Political Dimension

**Holkar Identifies:**
- Madho Singh called Abdali
- Najib Khan called Abdali
- This was **coordinated**
- Political conspiracy against Marathas

**The Insight:**
- Understands the politics
- But can't do anything about it
- Outnumbered
- Outmaneuvered
- Outplayed

### Abdali Walks Into Delhi

**The Stunning Reality:**
- Just **walks in**
- Appoints his own governor
- **No resistance**

**Why:**
- Imad fled to Suraj Mal
- No one to defend
- Holkar won't fight
- City undefended

**What It Means:**
- **Capital has fallen**
- Symbolic center lost
- Abdali can claim victory
- Psychological blow to all India

### The Underestimation Pattern

**Dattaji's Error:**
- Thought Abdali was **"namard"** (coward)
- Because led from rear
- Underestimated him
- **Died for it**

**Holkar's Wisdom:**
- **Doesn't** underestimate Abdali
- Knows his reputation
- Seen him in action
- Heard first-hand accounts
- **Won't fight** without overwhelming force

**The Contrast:**
- Youth vs. experience
- Courage vs. caution
- Glory vs. survival
- Dattaji = dead hero
- Holkar = live coward (or smart tactician?)

### The Pregnant Wife Detail

**Why Include This:**
- Shows **Dattaji's foresight**
- Sent dependents ahead
- Knew battle could go wrong
- Protected family

**The Tragedy:**
- Caught up to them anyway in retreat
- Could have been captured
- Now widow with unborn child
- Escorted to safety after his death

## What's Coming

**The Situation:**
- Dattaji dead
- 20,000 man army routed
- Holkar now responsible
- But won't fight frontally
- Abdali in Delhi
- Appointed his own governor
- Total control of capital

**The Question:**
- How will Holkar respond?
- Can't fight head-on
- Too outnumbered
- Surgical strikes only
- Will it be enough?

**The Bigger Question:**
- News reaching Pune (~Feb 13)
- Nanasaheb will be **shocked**
- Will have to send **major force**
- Can't be half-measures anymore
- **Comprehensive response** needed

---

**January 1760: "Bachenge to aur bhi ladenge." If I survive, I will fight even more. Those are the last words of a dying man who was right about his death and wrong about everything else. Dattaji charged with his spear against artillery and muskets, certain that Abdali was a coward who led from the rear. He was brave. He was wrong. Qutub Shah, Najib's jihadi teacher, beheaded him and sent his head as a trophy to Abdali. Twenty thousand Maratha soldiers stood by and watched. Then they ran for 140 miles, chased for 40 miles, arriving half-naked and broken. Holkar shows up a few days later. He's 50 years old. He knows Abdali's reputation. He won't fight frontally. He'll do surgical strikes. He'll preserve his army. Is he a coward or the only smart one left? Meanwhile, Abdali just walks into Delhi and appoints his own governor. No resistance. The capital has fallen. And a messenger is riding south to Pune with news that will end eight days of celebration and wake up a Peshwa who's been asleep at the wheel. Everything changes on February 13.**
