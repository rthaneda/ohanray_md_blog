# The Death of Shahu & The Mughal Emperor Becomes a Burden (1749-1754)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Chapter Title: "Marathas Win Battles, But Lose Friends"

**The paradox:** Military victories that alienate potential allies and create more enemies than they solve problems.

---

## The Letter from Holkar

### The New Emperor Announcement

**From:** Malhar Rao Holkar
**To:** Raghunath Rao Peshwa

**Content summary:**
- The old emperor and his mother have been **imprisoned**
- A new emperor has been placed on the throne: **Alamgir II**
- The Marathas (specifically Holkar) orchestrated this
- They went around Delhi making announcements
- Had ceremonies with music and celebrations
- "Your success and glory is seen by all residents of the capital"

**What this shows:** The Marathas have completely manipulated the foundation of the Mughal Empire. They're kingmakers now.

## The Death of Shahu: Losing the Moderating Influence (1749)

### Who Was Shahu?

**Shahu Maharaj** = The stabilizing force for the Maratha Empire

**His role:**
- Had a **modest/moderate influence** on the rising ambitions of Maratha warriors
- Acted as a brake on unlimited expansion
- Someone the commanders were accountable to

### What Shahu Prevented

**If it had been left to Bajirao I alone:**
- He would have **taken over the Mughal throne** in Delhi
- Would have replaced the Mughal Emperor with Maratha rule
- Completely destroyed the Mughal Empire

**But Shahu said NO:**
- "We don't want to get rid of the Mughal Emperor"
- "We shouldn't establish Maratha rule in Delhi"
- "Don't get into destroying the Mughal Empire completely"
- Basically: slow down, be strategic, don't overreach

---

## The Post-Shahu Power Vacuum

### 1749: Shahu Dies

**The aftermath:**
- Maratha chiefs had **no one left to be accountable to**
- No more moderating influence
- No one to keep ambitious commanders in check
- Control over capable Maratha commanders in the north was gone

### The Generation Gap Problem

**The commanders who flourished under Bajirao I:**
- Holkar
- Jayapa Shinde  
- Gayakwad

**These guys were:**
- Older and more experienced than Nana Saheb Peshwa
- Battle-hardened veterans
- Extremely knowledgeable about North India politics
- Originally just normal soldiers mentored by Bajirao I
- Proved themselves and got promoted by Bajirao I
- Felt ownership over their achievements

**Nana Saheb Peshwa's challenge:**
- He was just Bajirao I's **son**
- NOT a warrior himself
- More of an **administrator, thinker, planner**
- These commanders were basically his father's peers
- He couldn't command them the way his father did
- They had already proven themselves before he became Peshwa

---

## The Distance Problem: Strategic Autonomy

### The Communication Challenge

**From Pune to Delhi:**
- About **1.5 months travel time** one way
- To get a response back = **3 months total**

**The impossibility:**
- Commanders in Delhi couldn't wait 3 months for every decision
- Some decisions needed to be made immediately
- **Strategic autonomy was necessary**

**The result:**
- Commanders made sovereign decisions without waiting for approval
- Peshwa would learn about these decisions **afterwards**
- Unless they could afford to wait and send a messenger

---

## The Empire Builders: Personal Fiefdoms

### The Commanders' Mentality

**These Maratha commanders were planning:**
- To increase territory **under their own control**
- Creating personal power bases
- Felt like **primary owners** of new territories
- Empire was expanding rapidly - they wanted their piece

**The dynamic:**
- Peshwa was the chief/sovereign (first among equals)
- But **Sadashiv Rao Bhau** was also important (cousin with strategic mind)
- Together they were the decision-making team
- But reality was messier - commanders operated semi-independently

---

## The Mughal Empire: Fragmentation

### The Loss of Cohesion

**During Aurangzeb's time:**
- Mughal Empire was **integrated and cohesive**
- Kingdoms tightly tied to the Mughal Emperor
- Central control was real

**Now (1750s):**
- That cohesiveness was **completely lost**
- Kingdoms that were tied to Mughals were getting their freedom back
- Operating **independently** (but wouldn't publicly declare independence)
- Loosely connected to Mughal Empire in name only

**The situation:**
- These kingdoms took liberties, had their own policies
- Would say "Yeah, we're part of Mughal Empire" publicly
- But in reality, **may or may not listen to the Emperor**
- Complex, fragmented political landscape

---

## The Buffalo Analogy: The Emperor Becomes a Burden

### Traditional Indian Farming Practice

**The custom:**
- Farmers tie a **big wooden log around cattle's neck**
- **Why:** So buffalo/cows can't run away at speed
- Slows them down, weighs them down
- Keeps them from escaping

### The Analogy Applied to Marathas

**The Mughal Emperor = The wooden log around Marathas' neck**

**The situation:**
- Marathas had made the **Ahadnama** contract (with Ahmad Shah, previous emperor)
- Contracted to **protect the Mughal Empire and the Emperor**
- But the Emperor was **so weak** he couldn't do anything
- Based only in Delhi, no real power beyond that

**The contradiction:**
1. **On one hand:** Marathas were duty-bound/contract-bound to protect him
2. **On the other hand:** He took all the liberties to do whatever he wanted
3. No restrictions on his behavior
4. He would create problems
5. **Marathas had to fix those problems**

### The Emperor's Empty Promises

**Example situations:**
- Emperor says: "You can have the tax rights (*chauth/sardeshmukhi*) of Agra and Ajmer"
- **Problem:** If those districts are controlled by the King of Awadh, and he says no?
- Emperor's word means **nothing** - you still have to fight for it

- Emperor says: "You can collect revenue from Punjab"  
- **Problem:** If Punjab is under Abdali's influence?
- Doesn't mean anything - you have to fight Abdali and kick him out first

**The reality:** Emperor was an obstruction, not an asset. Weighing Marathas down while creating headaches.

## The Regional Powers: Everyone Is Semi-Independent

### The Northern Threats

| Power | Territory | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Rohilla Afghans** | Rohilkhand | Independent operations |
| **Awadh** | Eastern UP | Safdar Jang → Shuja-ud-Daula (semi-independent) |
| **Rajputs** | Rajasthan | Semi-independent kingdoms |
| **Abdali** | Claims Punjab | Totally ignoring boundaries, says "Punjab is mine" |

**The Abdali problem:**
- Afghanistan's land is **not fertile**
- So Abdali claimed **Punjab** (super fertile, lots of water)
- Punjab traditionally part of Mughal Empire
- Abdali: "Nah, it's Afghanistan now"
- This was completely unacceptable to Mughals
- But what could they do about it?

---

### The Southern Powers

| Power | Territory | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Nizam** | Hyderabad | Allied with Mughals but had sovereignty |
| **Siddhis** | Janjira (Genjira) | Independent naval power |
| **British** | Surat, Mumbai | Starting to understand they could rule |
| **Portuguese** | Goa | Already ruling |
| **French** | Pondicherry (deep south) | Colonial presence |

**The European realization:**
- British hadn't started reinforcing territories yet
- But they **understood the deep divisions** in the country
- Recognized the weaknesses
- Realized: "We could rule this place one day"
- Goa was already being ruled by Portuguese
- The groundwork for colonialism was being laid

---

## All the Regional Enemies

**The complete picture:**
- Regional powers spread **all through India**
- Each one ambitious and opportunistic
- Marathas had nominal power through the Mughals
- But reality = **death by a thousand cuts**
- All these "minor paper cuts" to deal with
- Each one reacting quickly and efficiently (unlike Marathas)

**Why regional powers were dangerous:**
- They were **"self-contained compact powers"**
- Could react quickly to situations
- Focused efficiently
- NOT spread thin like Marathas
- Each one in their territory = very strong

---

## The Marathas' Impossible Position

### The Contradictions

**The Maratha paradox:**
1. Have power over Mughals **in name**
2. Required to be the Mughal Emperor's **babysitter**
3. Emperor free to do **whatever stupidity he wants**
4. Marathas have to **fix all his problems**
5. But also deal with **multiple regional enemies**
6. All while being **spread thin** across a massive territory

**They're kingmakers but also cleanup crew.**

---

## The Jat Problem & Kumbher Fort

### Who Are the Jats?

**Jats:** Warrior community/tribe (like Sikhs, but not Sikhs)
- Based in and around **Agra**
- Warrior-like community even today
- King: **Surajmal Jat**
- Small kingdom: **Bharatpur** (near Agra)
- Ambitious character who wanted to be kingmaker in Delhi

### The Alliance Structure

**Remember the factional split:**
- Marathas + Imad-ul-Mulk + Emperor (one side)
- Safdar Jang + Shuja-ud-Daula + Surajmal Jat (other side)

**Why target Surajmal now:**
- It wasn't enough to punish Safdar Jang alone
- His **allies also had to pay a price**
- Especially Surajmal Jat, whose troops created terror in Delhi
- The Emperor gave 1 crore rupees to Marathas to "take care of the situation"
- That includes putting Surajmal in his place

---

## The Stage Is Set

**The chapter ends with:**
- Marathas winning battles
- But creating more enemies
- Losing friends and potential allies
- The Mughal Emperor = dead weight around their neck
- Regional powers all watching for opportunities
- And Surajmal Jat about to face the consequences at Kumbher Fort

---

## Key Players

| **Bajirao I** | Former Peshwa | Dead, but his protégés still active |
| **Holkar** | Commander | Experienced, older than Nana Saheb |
| **Jayapa Shinde** | Commander | Experienced, older than Nana Saheb |
| **Gayakwad** | Commander | Experienced, older than Nana Saheb |
| **Raghunath Rao** | Commander | Nana Saheb's brother |
| **Sadashiv Rao Bhau** | Commander | Nana Saheb's cousin, strategic mind |
| **Mughal Emperor** | Alamgir II | Puppet, creates problems |
| **Surajmal Jat** | Jat king | Controls Kumbher Fort, shrewd |

---

## Timeline

| Date | Event |

## Critical Insights

### The Shahu Factor
- His death removed the **adult in the room**
- Ambitious commanders no longer had anyone to answer to
- Unlimited expansion became the goal
- No one to say "slow down"

### The Generational Problem
- Nana Saheb had to manage his father's peers
- They were more experienced than him
- He lacked his father's warrior credibility
- Made controlling them nearly impossible

### The Communication Curse
- 3-month decision cycle was unworkable
- Forced commanders to act independently
- Created inconsistent strategy
- Peshwa found out about decisions after the fact

### The Emperor Paradox
- Contractually bound to protect him
- But he was a liability, not an asset
- Created problems Marathas had to solve
- His promises were worthless
- A burden weighing them down

### The Fragmentation Opportunity
- All these regional powers = future problems
- But also: sign that Mughal authority was dead
- British were taking notes
- Seeds of colonialism being planted
- Everyone operating for themselves

*Shahu's death unleashed the Maratha war machine, but it also removed the guardrails. The commanders were empire building for themselves, the Mughal Emperor was a millstone around their necks, and everyone from Kabul to Pondicherry was watching the chaos and thinking: "Opportunity." Meanwhile, the next chapter was about to be written at a fort in Agra, where a Jat king was about to find out what happens when you make enemies of the Marathas.*
