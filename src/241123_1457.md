# Dattaji Shinde's Punjab Campaign & Strategic Appointments (1759)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Double-Dealing of Madho Singh

### Secret Alliance with Abdali

**Madho Singh of Jaipur** was playing a dangerous double game:
- Publicly: Agreeing to pay tribute to Marathas
- Secretly: **Corresponding with Abdali** and following his instructions
- Mission from Abdali: **Obstruct Marathas at every opportunity**

**Malhar Rao's Ignorance:**
- Malhar Rao Holkar had no idea about this secret alliance
- He was operating under the assumption that Madho Singh was cooperating

**The Strategy:**
- Madho Singh used every opportunity to create trouble for the Marathas
- This was direct advice from Abdali
- All northern powers were coordinating against Maratha expansion

---

## Delhi Power Dynamics (Early 1759)

### Force Positions

**When Dattaji and Jankoji arrived at Delhi:**
- Malhar Rao was still in Pune (not yet in the north)
- The two Shinde commanders were at the gates of Delhi

### The Vazir's Promise

**Mughal Vazir (Imad-ul-Mulk):**
- Promised to pay tribute/indemnity to Dattaji
- This was to buy time and appease the Marathas
- Money was always the negotiation tool

---

## Crossing the Yamuna (January 1759)

### Burari Ghat Encampment

**Strategic Position:**
- Dattaji's army camped at **Burari Ghat** on the Yamuna River
- Location: A few miles **north of Delhi**
- Yamuna flows on the western side of Delhi, leaving the city on the western bank

**The Crossing:**
- **Water levels had receded** (post-monsoon period)
- Timing: **January 1759** (dry season)
- This allowed troops to cross from western to eastern bank

**Why Cross?**
- To pursue **Najeeb Khan Rohila**
- Rohilas' territory (Rohilkhand) was on the eastern side
- Dattaji wanted to pressure this natural enemy

---

## The Peshwa's Power Play

### Deciding the Vazir Position

**Unprecedented Authority:**
- The Peshwa (sitting in Pune) was now deciding **who becomes Vazir** of the Mughal court in Delhi
- This shows how far Maratha power had extended
- The Emperor in Delhi had become essentially a puppet

**The Target:**
- Peshwa wanted to **remove Imad-ul-Mulk** from the Vazir position
- This was part of ongoing political maneuvering

---

## Personality Contrast: Dattaji vs. Malhar Rao

### Different Leadership Styles

**Dattaji Shinde's Approach:**
- **Brusque and impatient** (*Adhir* = impatient)
- **To the point** (*Tuttak* = direct, no-nonsense)
- Wanted results quickly
- No time for "hanky panky discussions"
- Demanded action and compliance immediately

**Malhar Rao Holkar's Approach:**
- More patient and accommodating
- Willing to engage in longer negotiations
- Not as quick to demand immediate action
- More diplomatic in style

**Impact on Mughal Court:**
- The Delhi court had to adjust to this new, more aggressive Maratha personality
- Previous dealings with Malhar Rao had been more relaxed
- Now they faced a soldier who would "brook no nonsense"

**Dattaji's Order to Imad-ul-Mulk:**
- He **ordered** (*pharmaula*) Imad to accompany him
- Purpose: To preserve relationship with the emperor
- This was not a request—it was a command

## The Punjab Problem

### Why Punjab Was a Headache

**Distance from Home:**
- Punjab was **extremely far** from Maharashtra (Maratha homeland)
- Cultural differences: Different language, customs
- Climate: Much colder than Maharashtra

**Why They Couldn't Leave:**
- Contractual obligation: Marathas had signed agreement to protect Mughal Empire
- Punjab was under constant threat from Afghan invasions
- Abdali could use it as entry point to Delhi

**The Maratha Dilemma:**
- Soldiers didn't want to stay in Punjab long-term
- But they had to maintain presence to fulfill their duty
- It was a constant burden

### The Population Problem

**Two Competing Power Centers:**

1. **Muslim Majority:**
   - Punjab's population was predominantly Muslim
   - They viewed Marathas (Hindu) as outsiders
   - Natural resistance to Maratha authority

2. **Rising Sikh Power:**
   - Sikhs were gaining strength and organization
   - Multiple Sikh tribes operating in Punjab
   - Had aspirations of their own political power
   - Even though Hindu-Sikh relations were close, Sikhs said: "You're outsiders, this is our home"

**Caught in the Middle:**
- Marathas had to deal with hostile Muslim citizenry
- AND navigate Sikh aspirations for independence
- Sikhs were anti-Muslim but also wanted Marathas gone
- Neither group wanted foreign (Maratha) rule

---

## Supply and Support Issues

### Marathas Were Struggling With:

1. **Shortage of supplies** (*Sadhanancha abhav*)
2. **Local population against them**
   - Muslims opposed them religiously
   - Sikhs opposed them politically
3. **Distance from supply lines**
4. **Weak Mughal authority** to back them up

**The Realization:**
- Dattaji came to understand the massive **obstacles in safeguarding Punjab**
- He realized this was potentially a losing battle
- Questions arose: "Is it really worth staying here?"

---

## The Western Push (April 1759)

### Reaching the Sutlej River

**Timeline:** Up until **April 1759**

**Geographic Progress:**
- Dattaji pushed all the way to the **Sutlej River**
- Sutlej = major river flowing through Punjab
- Eventually empties into the Indus River (Sindhu)
- This was moving **westward** into deeper Punjab territory

### Meeting with Sabaji Shinde

**Sabaji Shinde:**
- Came from **Peshawar** (far northwest, near Kabul/Afghanistan border)
- Likely a relative of Dattaji (possibly not brother, but family)
- Had been stationed in Peshawar to watch the Afghan invasion route

**Purpose of Meeting:**
- Dattaji needed to understand the political situation from someone on the ground
- Sabaji had been based in that region and knew the dynamics
- Strategic discussion about defending the western frontier

---

## Strategic Appointments in Punjab

### Dattaji's Mission

**Primary Objective from Peshwa:**
1. Stabilize Punjab
2. Understand the political landscape
3. Make key appointments so Maratha presence could be maintained
4. Prevent outside aggression (mainly from Afghanistan)

**The Appointments:**

| Location | Commander | Role |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **Peshawar** | Sabaji Shinde | Western frontier defense (closest to Afghanistan) |
| **Atak** | Tukoji Holkar | Northern defense |
| **Multan** | Bappuji Trimbak | Southern Punjab |
| **Lahore** | Naro Shankar | Central Punjab (capital city) |

**The Strategy:**
- These commanders and their armies would safeguard respective regions
- Create a defensive network across Punjab
- Prevent Abdali from using Punjab as invasion corridor to Delhi
- Intercept any Afghan forces **before** they could threaten Delhi or eastern territories

---

## The Larger Strategic Picture

### Abdali's Threat Assessment

**Why Punjab Mattered:**
- Any Afghan invasion **must** pass through Punjab to reach Delhi
- Punjab had to be stable with strong Maratha leadership
- The goal: **Stop Abdali in Punjab, not let him get further east**

**The Challenge:**
- Abdali's armies were familiar with the terrain
- They had support networks in the region
- Maratha armies were overstretched and undersupplied

### Implementation Phase

**What Came Next:**
- Dattaji began implementing the Peshwa's strategy
- First element: Secure and stabilize Punjab ✓
- Next objectives:
  1. Move towards Delhi and handle Najeeb Khan
  2. Head east towards Bengal for revenue collection
  3. Maintain communication lines

---

## Resource Constraints

### Why This Was Nearly Impossible

**Sabaji Shinde's Problem:**
- He was "Peshawar's man" but had **insufficient forces**
- Given a critical job without adequate resources
- Expected to defend the most vulnerable invasion route
- This foreshadows future problems

**Pattern of Overstretching:**
- Marathas kept taking on more territory
- But couldn't provide enough troops or supplies
- Commanders set up to fail
- The empire was expanding faster than capacity to hold it

### 2. Cultural Clash
Hindu Maratha armies trying to govern hostile Muslim populations and navigate Sikh aspirations.

### 3. Leadership Styles Matter
Dattaji's aggressive, no-nonsense approach contrasted sharply with previous Maratha diplomacy.

### 4. Secret Alliances
Regional powers like Madho Singh were coordinating with Abdali behind Maratha backs.

### 5. The Punjab Dilemma
A territory that HAD to be defended but was nearly impossible to hold effectively.

---

## What's Coming Next

**Immediate Priorities:**
- Dattaji must maintain Punjab stability
- Deal with Najeeb Khan situation
- Eventually move east toward Bengal for revenue
- Keep defensive network functioning with limited resources

**Looming Threats:**
- Abdali is watching and waiting
- Secret alliances working against Marathas
- Undersupplied commanders vulnerable
- Long supply lines and distance from home

---

*The Marathas are playing a dangerous game—stretched thin across hostile territory, relying on commanders who don't have enough support, facing enemies who are coordinating behind the scenes. Dattaji's aggressive style might get things done quickly, but the structural problems of holding Punjab remain unsolved.*
