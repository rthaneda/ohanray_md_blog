# Maratha Northern Strategy & Raghoba's Triumph (1752-1756)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Recap: The Civil War Aftermath

**The conflict so far:**
- **Safdar Jang's faction** (with Surajmal Jat and Madho Singh) vs. **Everyone else** (Marathas, Emperor, Imad-ul-Mulk)
- Safdar Jang was defeated
- His son **Shuja-ud-Daula** (also called Itnizam ud-Daula) negotiated terms
- Imad-ul-Mulk wanted to punish Safdar Jang by giving his territories to the Marathas
- **Shuja-ud-Daula refused** → Created long-term enmity with Imad-ul-Mulk

---

## The Peshwa Family Tree (Critical for Understanding)

### Bajirao I's Sons
1. **Nana Saheb Peshwa** (elder son) - Current Peshwa, based in Pune
2. **Raghunath Rao Peshwa** (younger son) - Ambitious warrior, sent to Delhi

### Bajirao I's Brother
- **Chimaji Appa** → His son is **Sadashiv Rao Bhau**

**Key Point:** Sadashiv Rao Bhau (the cousin) will eventually lead the Panipat campaign, NOT Raghunath Rao (the brother). This decision will have massive consequences.

---

## Why Sadashiv Rao Instead of Raghunath Rao?

### The Characters

| Person | Personality | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Raghunath Rao** | Political, flexible | Knows North India politics well, negotiator, experienced | Ambitious, expensive |
| **Sadashiv Rao Bhau** | Disciplinarian, strict | Strong military commander, strategic mind | Hot temper, inflexible, "my way or highway" |

### Why This Matters for Panipat

**Raghunath Rao's advantages:**
- Understood northern politics intimately
- Could negotiate and compromise
- Flexible in difficult situations
- Politically savvy

**Sadashiv Rao's limitations:**
- More of a disciplinarian - very strict
- Quick to anger, had a temper
- Wouldn't tolerate any misbehavior
- Created problems with inflexibility

**The verdict:** If Raghunath Rao had led Panipat, it would have been a **different battle** - still tough, but the political maneuvering could have changed the outcome.

---

## The Commanders Arrive (But Too Late)

### The Three Warriors Sent North

Nana Saheb Peshwa dispatched:
1. **Raghunath Rao Peshwa** (his brother)
2. **Malhar Rao Holkar**
3. **Jayapa Shinde**

**Plot twist:** By the time they arrived in Delhi, Safdar Jang had already been defeated and retreated to Awadh. So the big army showed up after the main battle was over!

---

## Historical Flashback: The Marathas in the South (1752-1756)

### 1752: The Failed Nizam Installation

**May 1752:** Marathas took **Ghazi-ud-Din** (chosen to be the new Nizam) from Delhi to Hyderabad to install him on the throne.

**October 1752:** A royal woman in Hyderabad **poisoned and killed him** → Situation became "Chigarli" (explosive/highly complex)

**Consequences:**
- Ghazi-ud-Din's son got scared and fled back to Delhi
- He became Safdar Jang's protégé → Later became **Imad-ul-Mulk** (Mir Bakshi)
- **Eventually betrayed Safdar Jang** despite Safdar Jang being his benefactor

**Why this matters:** This explains Imad-ul-Mulk's background and how he rose to power.

---

### The Replacement Nizam: Salabat Jang

After Ghazi-ud-Din's murder, **Salabat Jang** became the new Nizam (not Ghazi-ud-Din's family).

**The French Connection:**
- Salabat Jang hired **Bussy** (Charles de Bussy) - a Frenchman
- Role: Chief of the **cannon force**
- Why: Europeans had superior cannon technology that India lacked

---

### The Battle of Balki & Territory Gains

**Marathas defeated:**
- Bussy (the French cannon chief)
- Salabat Jang (the Nizam)

**Maratha gains:**
- **Nasik** (between Tapi and Godavari rivers)
- **Trambak Fort**
- Territory that had to be ceded to the Peshwa

---

### 1756: Emotional Victory

**Nana Saheb Peshwa captured Shivneri Fort** from the Mughals.

**Why this matters:**
- This is where **Shivaji was born**
- Small fort near Pune, not strategically critical
- But **HUGE emotional value** to Marathas
- Shivaji = founder of the empire, everyone looked up to him
- Getting his birthplace back = symbolic victory

---

## Raghoba's Northern Triumph

### The Legendary Campaign

**Raghoba** = Raghunath Rao Peshwa's nickname ("dada" means elder brother - honorific)

**What he achieved:**
- Led Maratha army to **Punjab**
- Kicked out Abdali's remnants from Punjab
- Went all the way to **ATTOCK** (border with Afghanistan)

### Why ATTOCK is Huge

**Location:** Modern-day Pakistan (Punjab province), at the extreme frontier with Afghanistan

**Significance:** 
- âŒ **Hindu forces had NEVER gone this far north before**
- ✅ This was the **high point of Maratha northern expansion**
- ✅ Raghoba achieved the "almost unachievable" and "impossible task"
- ✅ Returned as a **victorious Maratha warrior**

---

## The Money Problem

### The Cost of Victory

Despite the incredible success, there was a major issue:

**Raghoba spent TOO MUCH money** on the campaign:
- Had to support a huge number of soldiers in the north
- Nana Saheb Peshwa had to take out massive loans
- The debt was becoming unsustainable

---

## The Fateful Decision: Who Goes to Panipat?

### The Meeting

When it came time to send forces north again, a meeting was held to select the commander.

**First choice:** Raghoba
- He knew northern politics inside and out
- He had proven himself militarily
- He understood who was who and how things worked

### Why Raghoba Was Rejected

**Nana Saheb said NO:**
- Raghoba was too expensive
- He demanded **1 crore rupees** (10 million) to fund the next northern campaign
- "I can't send you back"

**Raghoba's response (pride):**
- "If you don't want me to go as commander-in-chief, I won't go at all"
- "I won't go as any lesser personality"
- He refused to serve under someone else

---

### The Alternative: Sadashiv Rao

**Result:** Sadashiv Rao was selected to go north instead.

**This is how Sadashiv Rao ended up leading the Panipat campaign** - essentially because Raghoba was too expensive and too proud.

**The irony:** Raghoba was extremely successful in the north, captured unprecedented territory, and proved he could handle the politics and warfare. But cost too much.

## Critical Insights

### The Expense Problem
- Military campaigns in the north were EXTREMELY costly
- Maintaining armies far from home base drained resources
- Loans were piling up on Nana Saheb
- This financial pressure influenced major strategic decisions

### The Pride Factor
- Raghoba's pride prevented him from serving under someone else
- This pride + expense = he didn't go to Panipat
- A less experienced commander (Sadashiv Rao) went instead

### The Politics vs. Discipline Dilemma
- Northern campaigns required political savvy (Raghoba's strength)
- But also military discipline (Sadashiv Rao's strength)
- You needed BOTH - but they picked the disciplinarian
- This would have consequences at Panipat

---

*Raghoba went where no Hindu army had ever gone before - to the gates of Afghanistan itself. But being too successful and too expensive meant he wouldn't get to finish what he started. Instead, his cousin would take the reins... and history would take a dark turn at Panipat.*
