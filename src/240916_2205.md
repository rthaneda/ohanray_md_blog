# The Court Rivalries Deepen
## Kamruddin's Faction & The Sunni-Shia Battle for Control

---

## Quick Recap

**Where We Are:**
- Mansoor Khan = Safdar Jung (same person)
- He became Governor of Awadh after bribing Nadir Shah with 2 crore rupees
- Got title "Safdar Jung" (Lion of Battle)
- By 1743, appointed Head of Artillery and Governor of Kashmir
- Court is split: **Irani/Shia faction** (Safdar Jung) vs. **Turani/Sunni faction** (Rohillas/Afghans)
- Marathas allied with Safdar Jung → Rohillas can't match them militarily

---

## The Battle History: Safdar Jung vs. Malhar Rao Holkar

### Understanding the Timeline

**1737 (Two Years Before Nadir Shah):**
- Safdar Jung (with Saadat Khan) **defeated** Malhar Rao Holkar
- Holkar was one of the commanders Bajirao I appointed to the North
- Safdar Jung helped his uncle Saadat Khan win this battle

**1738 (One Year Before Nadir Shah):**
- When Safdar Jung was going to help Nizam ul-Mulk in the South
- Near Bhopal
- Malhar Rao Holkar **defeated** him (or drove him back to Delhi)

**The Score:** 1-1 - They had a history of trading victories

**Critical Context:** This is **BEFORE** Nadir Shah's 1739 invasion that changed everything.

## The Nadir Shah Watershed Moment (1739)

### How One Event Changed The Equation

**Before 1739:**
- Mughals and Marathas were competitive rivals
- They'd win some, lose some
- Normal military competition

**Nadir Shah Arrives (1739):**
- Creates **total terror** in Delhi
- Literally **massacres thousands and thousands** of people
- A **different level of cruelty**
- Even the Mughals (who were "pretty torturous people") thought this was **inhuman**
- Another level beyond what they'd ever seen or done

### The Realization

**What Mughals Understood:**
- "We are **incapable of dealing with external aggressors**"
- This violence was something they had **never even seen or done**
- "We can't take this"

**The Strategic Shift:**
- Started **inclining towards Marathas** for help
- Needed real military power
- That's when alliances began forming
- **This changed everything**

---

## After Nadir Shah Left: The Succession Bribe

### The Claimants

**After Saadat Khan Died:**
- **Three, four, maybe five people** claimed they were the true heir to Awadh
- Not just one or two - multiple claimants

### Mansoor Khan's Winning Move

**What He Did:**
- Put forth his case "in a very auspicious and strong manner"
- **Why?** He was Saadat Khan's **son-in-law**
- Paid **two crore rupees** (20 million) as tribute to Nadir Shah

### Understanding the Power Dynamic

**The Question:** Who was in charge then?

**The Answer:** Nadir Shah, NOT the Mughal Emperor

**The Reality:**
- Mughal Emperor was a **standby** - just there in name
- He was a **pawn of Nadir Shah**
- Nadir Shah was calling the shots
- **He** would be appointing the Subedar

**Mansoor Khan's Smart Move:**
- Instead of giving money to his "so-called boss" (the emperor)
- Gave it to **Nadir Shah** (the real power)
- Bribed the person who actually made decisions

---

## The Details of the Tribute

### What Was Sent

**The Cash:**
- **Two crore rupees** = 20 million rupees
- In 1739 money (absolutely massive sum)

**The Military Escort:**
- **200 Qizilbash soldiers**
- Typical Persian soldiers
- Specific Iranian-style attire and weapons
- Shows his Shia/Persian identity

**The Royal Gift:**
- A **huge elephant**
- Royal animal (symbol of power)
- Perfect diplomatic touch

### Why It Worked

**The Shia Connection:**
- Mansoor Khan = Shia Muslim
- Nadir Shah = Shia Muslim (from Iran)
- Same religious background
- Natural alliance

**The Message:**
- "I want to be in your good graces thoroughly"
- Well thought out presentation
- **Basically a sophisticated bribe**
- But presented as respectful tribute

---

## The Appointment Confirmed

### What Happened

**When Nadir Shah Went Back to Iran:**
- He basically appointed Mansoor Ali Khan as **Subedar of Awadh/Ayodhya**
- Gave him the honorific title **"Safdar Jung"**
- Meaning: Lion of the battlefield

**Clarification:**
- **Safdar Jung** = honorific title (like "Sir" or "Lord")
- His actual name = **Mansoor Ali Khan** (or Mansoor Khan)
- But now known by the title

---

## The Next Decade: 1740s Campaigns

### Following Orders

**What Safdar Jung Did:**
- Led many campaigns based on Mughal Emperor's orders
- One campaign to **Patna** (city in Bihar province)
- This is where **Nana Saheb Peshwa** had also reached during his invasion of Bengal

### The Holy Cities Issue

**The Setup:**
- **Varanasi** and **Gaya** = holiest places for Hindus
- Both under Safdar Jung's control (part of Awadh territory)
- Nana Saheb Peshwa wanted to visit them

**The Emperor's Order:**
- When Peshwa went to Varanasi and Gaya
- Emperor told Safdar Jung: **Go back to Awadh**
- Translation: "Don't bother Mr. Nana Saheb"
- Smart diplomatic move to avoid conflict

---

## The Delhi Promotion: 1743

### The Grand Entry

**What Happened:**
- Safdar Jung was called to Delhi
- Made a **grand entry** with lots of pomp
- He understood he might be made **wazir**

### What He Actually Got

**The Appointments:**
1. **Chief of the cannon regiment** (Head of Artillery)
2. **Subedar of Kashmir** (far north)

**Plus:**
- Kept his own kingdom of Awadh
- Given Kashmir governorship **on top of** Awadh
- Became the **highest Irani noble at the court**

**Not wazir yet** - but these positions set him up for it.

---

## Who Got Displaced: Kamruddin Khan

### The Turani Faction Leader

**Kamruddin Khan:**
- Existing wazir at the time
- Led the **Turani faction**
- His people previously held these positions
- **His loyalists** were "overlooked" (not considered)

### What "Overlooked" Means

**The Example:**
- "If I'm considering three candidates for a position"
- "I just say 'Okay Rohan, I'm not going to consider you, get out'"
- That's being overlooked
- **Kamruddin's faction got passed over for these key appointments**

---

## Understanding the Turani Faction

### Who They Were

**Kamruddin Khan and His Clan:**
- From **Central Asia** (Turkmenistan, Turkestan, etc.)
- **NOT modern Turkey** - these are Central Asian Turks
- North of Afghanistan
- **Sunni Muslims**
- Called "Turani" (Turkish/Central Asian)

### Their Natural Allies

**The Connection:**
- Have **camaraderie with Afghans**
- Same Sunni background
- Same general region ("in the same line")
- Natural alliance with Rohillas

---

## Important: Kamruddin's Fate (Foreshadowing)

### Remember This Character

**The Question:** What happened to Kamruddin later?

**The Answer:** He died in battle - his tent was **hit by a cannonball**

**When:** During the conflict with Abdali

**His Son:** **Mir Manu** (remember him?)

**Critical Detail:** At that time (when he died), Kamruddin was the **wazir**

### The Connection

This ties back to the **Siege of Lahore** we read about earlier:
- Mir Manu defended Lahore against Abdali
- His father Kamruddin had been wazir
- Kamruddin died when cannonball hit his tent
- This weakened the Turani/Sunni faction further

---

## The Factional Rivalry Explained

### The Religious Division

**Irani/Persian Faction:**
- Led by Safdar Jung
- **Shia Muslims**
- From Iran/Persia
- Persian cultural influence

**Turani/Afghan Faction:**
- Led by Kamruddin Khan
- **Sunni Muslims**
- From Central Asia and Afghanistan
- Afghan/Rohilla allies

### Why They Hated Each Other

**The Turani Position:**
- All Sunni Muslims
- Didn't want a **Shia** getting prominent positions
- Religious rivalry (Sunni vs. Shia is deep)
- Felt they were being put **under Safdar Jung's thumb**

**The Dynamic:**
- Kamruddin's faction **did not like** these appointments
- They asked: "Why are you getting this?"
- Felt passed over and disrespected

---

## The Nadir Shah Influence Factor

### Why Safdar Jung Got These Positions

**The Background:**
- Nadir Shah (Iranian Emperor) gave Safdar Jung the subedarship of Ayodhya
- Mughal Emperor was under pressure from Nadir Shah
- Emperor gave these new assignments partly due to that **influence**

**The Resentment:**
- It wasn't just merit
- It was **Iranian/Shia pressure** from Nadir Shah
- The Turani/Sunni faction saw this clearly
- Made them even more bitter

---

## The Strategic Reality: Why Rohillas Were Powerless

### The Military Math

**The Rohilla Problem:**
- Safdar Jung **knew to make alliances with Marathas**
- Got their commitment to defending Delhi
- Rohillas/Turanis **didn't have enough power** to defeat Safdar Jung
- Why? The Maratha factor

### The Track Record

**What Happened:**
- After Safdar Jung sought Maratha help
- Marathas won **quite a few battles** in and around the **Doab**
- Three or four pitched battles
- **Rohillas realized: "We are NO match for Marathas"**

**The Reality Check:**
- Fighting a **superior force**
- Can't win militarily
- Stuck in a **very weak spot**
- Can't defeat the Shia faction + Maratha alliance

---

## The Powder Keg

### The Situation by the Late 1740s

**Safdar Jung's Position:**
- Highest Irani noble at court
- Controls Awadh (wealthy kingdom)
- Governor of Kashmir
- Head of Artillery
- Allied with Marathas (military superiority)

**Turani/Rohilla Position:**
- Losing ground politically
- Can't win militarily
- Feel oppressed by Shia faction
- Resentful and desperate
- Need an external champion

### What's Coming

**The Inevitable:**
- Turanis/Rohillas can't accept this situation
- Too weak to fight Safdar Jung + Marathas
- Too proud to submit
- Need a powerful Sunni ally from outside
- **Enter: Ahmad Shah Abdali** (Sunni Afghan king with huge army)

## The Geographic Power Map

**Safdar Jung Controls:**
- **Awadh/Ayodhya** - His kingdom (very wealthy)
- **Kashmir** - Given in 1743 (far north)
- **Artillery** - Military power
- **Parts of Doab** - Through Maratha alliance

**Contested/Rohilla Areas:**
- Parts of the **Doab** - After Maratha victories
- **Rohilkhand** - Rohilla homeland, but weakened

**Strategic Cities:**
- **Varanasi** & **Gaya** - Holy cities under Safdar Jung's control
- **Delhi** - Imperial capital, factional battleground

---

## Strategic Analysis

### Safdar Jung's Brilliant Strategy

1. **Read the Room** - Knew Nadir Shah had real power, not the emperor
2. **Made the Right Friends** - Allied with Marathas (military superiority)
3. **Consolidated Power** - Multiple governorships + military command
4. **Used Shia Networks** - Leveraged Iranian connections
5. **Weakened Rivals** - Systematically displaced Turani faction

### Why the Turani/Rohilla Faction Was Trapped

1. **Military Inferiority** - Can't beat Marathas on battlefield
2. **Political Losses** - Lost key positions to Safdar Jung
3. **Foreign Pressure** - Nadir Shah's influence helped Safdar Jung
4. **Religious Isolation** - Shia faction has Iranian backing
5. **No Good Options** - Too weak to fight, too proud to submit

---

## The Religious Fault Line

### Why Sunni vs. Shia Matters

**It's Not Just Religious:**
- Political alliances form along religious lines
- Iranians (Shia) vs. Central Asians/Afghans (Sunni)
- Each side backs their own
- Compromise is seen as betrayal

**The Stakes:**
- Control of the wealthiest empire in the world
- Who influences the Mughal Emperor
- Who gets tax revenues
- Who holds military power

**The Divide:**
- Centuries-old schism
- Different interpretations of succession after Prophet Muhammad
- Shia: Ali and his descendants should lead
- Sunni: Elected caliphs were legitimate
- Now playing out in Indian politics

---

## The Abdali Connection (Setup)

### Why Rohillas Will Invite Him

**The Calculation:**
- Rohillas are Sunni Afghans
- Abdali is Sunni Afghan
- Same religious identity
- Same ethnic background
- Same enemy: the Shia-Maratha alliance

**The Inevitability:**
- Rohillas can't win alone
- Need powerful external Sunni champion
- Abdali is the only one who can match Maratha power
- He's already raided India before
- He wants Delhi's wealth
- Perfect alignment of interests

### What This Means for Panipat

**The Setup:**
- When Abdali comes back (and he will)
- Rohillas/Turanis will support him
- It becomes: **Sunni coalition (Abdali + Rohillas) vs. Shia-Hindu coalition (Safdar Jung + Marathas)**
- Religious war + political war + ethnic war
- All the fault lines will erupt at once

---

## Key Themes

1. **The Nadir Shah Effect** - One invasion changed the entire strategic calculation
2. **Religious Factions Rule Everything** - Sunni vs. Shia determines alliances
3. **Military Power Matters Most** - Marathas gave Safdar Jung untouchable status
4. **The Displaced Seek Revenge** - Turani faction won't forget being overlooked
5. **Bribing the Right Person** - Know who really has power
6. **Trading Victories Creates Respect** - Holkar and Safdar Jung's history matters

---

## The Irony Loop

**The Pattern:**
1. Safdar Jung defeats Holkar (1737) → They're enemies
2. Nadir Shah terrifies everyone (1739) → Mughals need help
3. Safdar Jung allies with Marathas → Now he's powerful
4. This alliance crushes Rohillas → They get desperate
5. Desperate Rohillas will invite Abdali → Sets up Panipat
6. Safdar Jung + Marathas must fight Abdali → The trap springs

**The Tragedy:**
- In making himself powerful through the Maratha alliance
- Safdar Jung created enemies who will bring Abdali
- The alliance that made him strong will commit him to a war
- That war will be **Panipat**

---

## Looking Forward

**What We Know:**
- Kamruddin will die (cannonball during Abdali conflict)
- His son Mir Manu defended Lahore
- Rohillas are weak and desperate
- Abdali has already taken Punjab
- Safdar Jung has committed Marathas to defend Delhi
- The factions are set
- The religious divisions are deep
- **War is inevitable**

---

**Where we left off:** Understanding the factional dynamics completely - Irani/Shia (Safdar Jung) vs. Turani/Sunni (Kamruddin/Rohillas), with Marathas tipping the balance. The Rohillas are trapped and desperate, setting up their eventual invitation to Abdali.

---

*The court politics, the religious divisions, the military realities - all pieces in place. The Rohillas know they're losing, and they know exactly who to call. Ahmad Shah Abdali is waiting in Afghanistan, and when the invitation comes, he'll bring hell with him.*
