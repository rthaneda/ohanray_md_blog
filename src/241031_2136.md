# The Systematic Looting of Delhi: Torture, Treasure & The Price of Hidden Wealth (January 1757)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Abdali's Ultimatum (Recap)

### The Demands

**What He Said:**
> "Good way or bad way, I have to get my wealth or ransom. Right now and right here. No loans or any business like that."

**Translation:**
- By any means necessary
- Immediately
- Cash only
- No negotiations
- No installment plans

---

## The First Big Score: Kamruddin Khan's Widow

### The Scared Informant

**Who Was Itni Zaam:**
- Some official/courtier
- **Scared to the core** (गर्भ गरित)
- Abdali was interrogating him
- He broke under pressure

**What He Did:**
- Pointed with his finger toward someone
- **Kamruddin Khan's widow** (Sholapuri Begum)
- Gave up her name to save himself

### The Threat to the Widow

**Abdali's Words to Her:**

> "If you show me the exact location of the hidden treasure, I would treat you like my mother or my sister. I will give you the honor of my mother or sister."

**OR:**

> "Otherwise, iron nails would be hit under your nails."

**Translation:**
- Show me = respect and safety
- Don't show me = extreme torture
- The choice is yours

### Who She Was

**Her Status:**
- Very highly placed in society
- Some famous person's mother
- Another famous person's widow
- Another notable's mother
- **Multiple connections to power**
- Very well-respected
- High social standing

**Why This Matters:**
- Even high-status women weren't safe
- Abdali would torture anyone
- No respect for traditional hierarchies
- The wealth was all that mattered

---

## THE HAUL: Three Days of Digging

### The Excavation

**Location:**
- Her **haveli** (mansion/estate)
- Remember: the reading group had been to a haveli in Rajasthan

**The Process:**
- **Three days** of continuous digging
- Following her instructions
- She told them where to dig
- She had no choice

### The Discovery

**What They Found:**
- **Approximately 2 crore rupees worth** of treasure
- Hidden beneath the ground
- In that single haveli

**Specific Items Found:**
- **मानसाची आकाराची दोनशी सोन्याची कांबी** 
  - Golden sticks in human form/shape
  - Elaborate gold sculptures
  - Buried in dirt

**And More:**
- Precious stones (अमूल्य हीरे)
- Diamonds (पत्सु)
- Rubies (माणिक)
- Pearls (मोती)
- Gold objects (सोन्या)
- Silver items (चांदी)
- **अगणित संपत्ती** - Incalculable/uncountable wealth

### Abdali's Reaction

**What He Did:**
- Took it all under his control (ताबात घेतला)
- **"Subhan Allah"** - Praise to God (Islamic expression of awe)
- Even he was impressed by the amount

---

## The Historical Accumulation

### How Much Wealth? From When?

**The Timeline:**
- Since **Aurangzeb's death** (1707)
- To 1757
- **70 years** of accumulation
- By **Kamruddin Khan** and his father **Amin Khan**

**What This Means:**
- Three generations of hoarding
- 70 years of hidden treasure
- All procured by powerful Wazirs
- Now taken by Ahmad Shah Abdali in one day

### The Bitter Irony

**What Kamruddin's Descendants Got:**
> "His descendants got only the dirt that was dug up in that haveli."

**Translation:**
- Ancestors accumulated for 70 years
- Hidden it carefully underground
- Abdali took it all in 3 days
- Descendants left with nothing but dirt
- Ultimate reversal of fortune

---

## Why They Buried Wealth

### No Banking System

**The Reality:**
- **No banks** existed
- No institutional security
- No safe deposit boxes
- Had to physically hide wealth

**The Method:**
- Bury it underground
- Hide in walls
- Secret rooms
- Only family knew locations

**The Reasons:**
1. **Pass it to posterity** - Leave inheritance
2. **Use for luxury** - When they wanted to indulge
3. **Security** - Felt safer buried than exposed
4. **Tax evasion** - Government couldn't confiscate what they couldn't find
5. **Political insurance** - If you fall from power, still have secret wealth

---

## The Raid on the Janan Khana (Women's Quarters)

### The Sacred Space Violated

**What Janan Khana Was:**
- **Women's quarters** (ज़नान खाना)
- Separate living area for women
- Hallmark of highly placed people:
  - Mansabdars
  - The Emperor
  - Very rich people
- Traditional, protected space
- Men (except family) not allowed

### The Raid

**What Happened:**
- Afghans raided the Janan Khana
- Broke all traditional boundaries
- **About 100 women were taken**

**Their Fates:**
| Group | Fate |
|-------|------|
| **Some** | Let go |
| **Selected ones** | Dispatched to Kabul (kidnapped) |

**The Violation:**
- Not just wealth theft
- But human trafficking
- Taking women as prizes
- Complete disregard for cultural norms
- Ultimate humiliation

---

## The Systematic City-Wide Looting

### खांती लगणे (Digging Everything)

**खांती** = Digging (खणने)
**खांती लगणे** = Starting to dig / digging operation

**The Scope:**
- **Every rich person's house was dug up**
- All Mansabdars targeted
- All courtiers
- Anyone who was "who's who" in Delhi
- No one was spared

### The Logic

**Why Dig Everywhere:**
- Abdali's soldiers realized the pattern
- If Kamruddin Khan buried wealth
- **Any rich person probably did the same**
- It was common practice
- Better to dig everywhere

**The Strategy:**
> "Let's just go after each and every rich person in Delhi. Dig up all their houses."

---

## छळ सत्र आणि आत्महत्या (Torture Sessions & Suicides)

### The New Normal

**छळ सत्र** = Schedule of torture
**आत्महत्या** = Suicide

**What Became Daily Routine:**
1. **Torture** - To extract information
2. **Suicides** - Out of fear or after torture

### Why This Happened

**The Reality:**
- You can't get wealth from rich people "just like that"
- **You have to torture them**
- Make them confess
- Nobody wants to give up hard-earned wealth
- People would rather die than reveal everything

**The Process:**
- Extreme torture became commonplace
- Daily occurrence
- Out of fear, many committed suicide
- Rather than face torture
- Or after being tortured

---

## Abdali's Background: He'd Seen This Before

### The 1739 Connection

**His Experience:**
- Had come to Delhi with **Nadir Shah of Iran in 1739**
- Seen firsthand all the wealth
- Knew what could be gotten out of Delhi
- This wasn't his first rodeo

### The Mughal Accumulation

**The Timeline:**
- **Babur came in 1526** (actually ~1526)
- By 1757: **About 230 years** of Mughal rule
- Mughals had accumulated wealth for over two centuries
- Most of it concentrated and hidden in Delhi

**Abdali's Knowledge:**
- Knew exactly what was there
- Had personal experience from 1739
- This time he's in charge
- Would extract even more than Nadir Shah did

---

## Mughalani Begum's Reward

### The Informant Gets Paid

**What She Did:**
- Gave Abdali all the intelligence about Delhi
- Named names
- Revealed who had what wealth
- Told him where to look
- Complete inside information

**Her Reward:**
- **Showered with rewards**
- Land grants
- Wealth
- Made good on her promise
- Handsomely rewarded

---

## The Forced Marriage

### Another Price

**What Happened:**
- Some man (likely Imad ul-Mulk based on context)
- **Had to divorce his wife**
- Was **married off to Mughalani's daughter (Umda Begum)**

**The Irony:**
- Remember this was promised to:
  1. First: Taimur (Abdali's son)
  2. Then: Imad ul-Mulk (as bribe for help)
  3. Now: Finally forced through

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows Abdali keeping track of promises
- Using marriage as political tool
- Forcing compliance through family ties
- Mughalani finally got what she wanted

---

## Letters from the Maratha Camp

---

## The Next Phase: Turning on Marathas and Jats

### After the Looting

**What Happened:**
- Abdali finished digging and confiscating
- Got the Mughals under control
- Went to Shalimar Bagh
- Then turned his attention to remaining resistance

**The New Targets:**

1. **Marathas** - Still fighting, won't accept his hegemony
2. **Jats** - Warrior community, still resisting

**Why:**
- They wouldn't accept his authority
- Still pockets of resistance
- Had to be dealt with
- Before he could consolidate control

---

## The Scale of Looting

### One Haveli = 2 Crores

**The Math:**
- Just ONE widow's house = 2 crore rupees
- There were **hundreds** of rich households in Delhi
- If each yielded even 10% of that = massive haul
- Plus the official imperial treasury
- Plus ongoing extortion

**The Estimate:**
- Total loot probably in the **tens of crores**
- Possibly over 100 crore rupees total
- Equivalent to the entire annual revenue of large provinces
- One of the biggest heists in history

---

## The Cultural Destruction

### What Was Lost

**Not Just Wealth:**

1. **Human Dignity** - Torture, humiliation, suicide
2. **Cultural Norms** - Janan Khana raided (unthinkable)
3. **Social Order** - High-status people tortured like criminals
4. **Family Heirlooms** - Generations of wealth lost
5. **Human Lives** - Suicides, torture deaths
6. **Women's Safety** - 100 kidnapped to Afghanistan
7. **Psychological Security** - Entire city traumatized

---

## The Torture Methodology

### Why Torture Was Necessary

**The Reality:**
- Rich people don't give up wealth willingly
- Hidden treasure requires information
- Only torture reliably extracts truth
- Fear of torture makes others comply
- Public torture creates mass compliance

**The Types:**
1. **Threat** - Like nails under nails (described to widow)
2. **Physical** - Beatings, mutilations
3. **Psychological** - Public humiliation
4. **Economic** - Confiscation of everything
5. **Social** - Family members threatened

---

## Key Themes

1. **The Price of Information** - Itni Zaam betrays widow to save himself
2. **Even High Status Isn't Protection** - Respected widow threatened with torture
3. **Generational Wealth Lost in Days** - 70 years of hoarding gone in 3 days
4. **Torture as Business Tool** - Systematic use to extract wealth
5. **Cultural Violations** - Janan Khana raided, women taken
6. **The Informant's Reward** - Mughalani gets rich for betraying Delhi
7. **Suicide as Escape** - People choosing death over torture
8. **City-Wide Operation** - Every rich house targeted
9. **Knowledge from Experience** - Abdali learned this in 1739
10. **Send It Home First** - Secure the loot immediately (to Afghanistan)

---

## The Maratha Response (or Lack Thereof)

### What the Letters Show

**From Antaji's Letter:**
- Marathas are **far from Delhi** (Faridabad, Mathura)
- Only killed "4-500 soldiers" - small skirmishes
- **Waiting for Peshwa to come** - no initiative
- Not safe to get closer
- Essentially observing, not fighting

**The Problem:**
- Small Maratha forces
- Not enough to challenge Abdali
- Need reinforcements from Pune
- But Pune is **1000+ km away**
- By the time help arrives, Delhi will be bled dry

---

## The Systematic Nature

### Abdali's Organization

**The Process:**

1. **Intelligence** - Get informants (Mughalani, scared officials)
2. **Threats** - Like to Kamruddin's widow
3. **Excavation** - Dig based on information
4. **Extraction** - Take everything found
5. **Expand** - Move to next house
6. **Secure** - Send treasure to Afghanistan immediately
7. **Repeat** - Until city is exhausted

**Why It Worked:**
- Had time (Marathas far away)
- Had information (insiders)
- Had force (no one could stop him)
- Had experience (done this before in 1739)
- Had no mercy (would torture anyone)

---

## The Irony of Hoarding

### The Futility of Hidden Wealth

**What They Thought:**
- Bury wealth = keep it safe
- Hidden = protected
- Future generations will benefit
- Political insurance

**What Actually Happened:**
- Everything found in days
- Torture extracts location
- Generations of saving lost
- Left with only dirt
- The hiding was futile

**The Lesson:**
> Wealth is only as secure as your society is stable. When conquest comes, buried gold is just a treasure map for invaders.

---

## Comparison to 1739

### Nadir Shah vs. Abdali

**Similarities:**
- Both came from north (Persia vs. Afghanistan)
- Both looted Delhi
- Both extracted massive wealth
- Both left Mughal emperor in place
- Both used torture

**Differences:**
- Nadir Shah was more brutal (massacred thousands)
- Abdali was more systematic (less killing, more extraction)
- Abdali had better intelligence (Mughalani's help)
- Abdali sent treasure home immediately
- Abdali aimed to come back (Nadir Shah didn't)

---

## What Comes Next

**Current Status:**
- Delhi systematically looted
- Treasure sent to Afghanistan
- Mughals under control
- Najib Khan installed as Wazir
- Marathas and Jats still resisting
- **Abdali now turns to deal with them**

**The Questions:**
1. How will he handle Marathas?
2. Will there be a major battle?
3. When will he leave Delhi?
4. How much total did he loot?
5. Will the Peshwa send reinforcements?
6. What happens to the kidnapped women?

**The Preview (from the reading):**
- The Battle of Panipat happens in **January 1761** (4 years away)
- But movements begin in 1760
- The two armies will face each other for **4-5 months** before fighting
- Both within **2 kilometers** of each other
- Both afraid to attack (know it will be mutual destruction)
- Multiple peace proposals will fail
- Final sticking point: **Punjab** (Abdali wants it, Marathas won't give it)
- **Jihadi clergy** around Abdali push for war
- **January 14, 1761** - The battle finally happens

---

**January-February 1757: A respected widow is threatened with nails under her nails. She reveals her family's 70-year treasure hoard. Three days of digging yields 2 crores. The Janan Khana is raided, 100 women taken. Every rich house in Delhi is dug up. Torture becomes daily routine. People commit suicide rather than face it. Mughalani gets rich for betraying her city. The treasure is sent to Afghanistan. Abdali turns to face the Marathas and Jats. Delhi lies bleeding. The looting of the century continues.**
