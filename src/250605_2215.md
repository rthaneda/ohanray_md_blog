# The Collapse: Defectors, Rumors, and Cascading Desertion
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Defector Problem (Early Afternoon)

**Who They Were:**
About 2,000 Afghan soldiers who had joined Maratha forces with Vittal Shivadev

**Where They Came From:**
From Kunjapura Fort:
- Marathas captured the fort
- Some defenders died, some were captured, some surrendered
- Those who surrendered agreed to fight with Marathas
- ~2,000 of them came over

**The Recruitment Logic:**
Marathas would "love to swell their ranks" - add numbers to their army.

**The Hidden Problem:**
> "These are not Abdali's camp defecting. These were potentially Kunjapura forces, and they were someone else's Afghan. That was a mistake. They may end up double-crossing Marathas."

They're not committed to Maratha cause—they're opportunists.

---

## The Identification System

**The Saffron Headgear:**
To prevent friendly fire/confusion:
- Defectors given saffron headgear/turbans
- Easily identifiable as "good Afghans" (allied with Marathas)
- Distinguishes them from Abdali's forces

**The Theory:**
"If we mark them, we'll know who's who in the chaos"

**The Reality:**
In chaos, nothing works perfectly.

---

## The Betrayal (Around 3 PM - After Vishwas Rao's Death)

**The Moment:**
When Vishwas Rao died and chaos erupted:
- Defectors threw away saffron headgear
- Switched sides immediately
- Revealed they were waiting for exact moment

**Their Position:**
- In rear lines of Maratha force
- Close to "Bunge" (support staff, non-combatants)
- Cooks, merchants, maintenance personnel
- All the logistics/supply people

**Their Attack:**
> "They started attacking these support staff on the Maratha side. They threw away their headgear and started fighting the Maratha side. They attacked the non-combatants in the back."

**The Tactical Impact:**
2,000 enemies suddenly appearing in the rear = complete breakdown of Maratha rear-guard security.

---

## The Psychological Amplification

**The Appearance vs. Reality:**
> "What appeared was that Abdali's army had reached all the way to the back of the Maratha camp."

Not true, but appeared true:
- Soldiers at front don't know defectors are only 2,000
- They see Afghans attacking from rear
- Think: "Afghan main force has broken through"
- Panic cascades

**The Rumors:**
- Vishwas Rao dead (fact)
- Afghans in rear (partially true—defectors)
- Abdali winning (unverified rumor)
- Battle is lost (false, but believed)

**The Information Problem:**
> "You cannot see the entire battlefield, like both sides. You only see 100 meters ahead of you. If this is what people are saying, then you tend to believe it."

Soldiers can't verify rumors. They only know:
- Their visible commander area
- What others are saying
- The general feeling

**The Rumor Effect:**
> "Rumor spreads faster than the truth."

By 3-4 PM:
- Rumor: Marathas are losing (partly true at this point)
- Rumor: Afghans in rear (defectors, but who knows that?)
- Rumor: Commander might be dead (Vishwas Rao is dead)
- Rumor: We should flee (natural conclusion)

---

## The Cascading Desertion

**First: Vittal Shivadev**
- Believed rumors/confusion
- Supposed to be fighting
- Left his position and fled
- Takes ~5,000 soldiers with him

**The Impact of Commander Leaving:**
> "When Tom, Dick, and Harry soldiers see their commanders fleeing, they think 'oh, that's over.' Their leader believed the rumors, so soldiers think the rumors must be true."

**Second: Damaji Gayakwar**
- Badly injured (already wounded)
- Was with Vittal Shivadev
- Follows Shivadev's retreat
- Takes ~3,000-4,000 soldiers
- These are his personal followers/army

**Third: Malhar Rao Holkar**
- Timing unclear (maybe ~1-2 PM or slightly later)
- Left battlefield with 5,000-6,000 soldiers
- Took western route toward Yamuna then south toward Delhi
- Gave safe passage by Najib Khan Rohila (the Afghan commander)

**Why Holkar Got Safe Passage:**
- Had good relationship with Najib Khan
- Najib made sure he "was given safe passage"
- Otherwise dangerous for Holkar (major commander) to escape alone with 6,000 soldiers
- Abdali would normally chase him
- But battle still ongoing, so Abdali forces couldn't spare manpower
- Holkar timed his escape perfectly

---

## Holkar's Motivation (Disputed)

**Theory 1: Forced Responsibility**
Before battle, Bhau allegedly told Holkar:
> "If we are on the losing side and if I am not to be seen or something happens, you have responsibility of saving my wife. Take her back to safety."

Holkar's wives came with him. So maybe he left to fulfill this duty?

**Theory 2: Strategic Disagreement**
- Holkar never believed in this battle plan
- Never liked frontal attack strategy
- Never believed in artillery power
- Fought for first 4-5 hours but then left
- Thinks: "I told you this wouldn't work"

**The Terrain Argument:**
Bhau said: "We're in flatland. There's no mountain, no jungle. We need artillery to compensate."

Holkar said: "Do the Ganimikawa style" (Shivaji's guerrilla tactics with terrain advantage)

Bhau: "There IS no terrain here. Your strategy won't work."

**The Reality:**
Probably both. Holkar:
- Was responsible for Bhau's wife (duty to leave early)
- Didn't believe in the plan (justification for leaving)
- Had strategic disagreements (ongoing tension)
- Timed his escape well (showed competence)

---

## The Net Effect

**The Number Loss:**
After Vishwas Rao's death, three major commanders left with ~13,000 soldiers:
- Vittal Shivadev: ~5,000
- Damaji Gayakwar: ~3,000-4,000
- Malhar Rao Holkar: ~5,000-6,000

**The Total:**
- Maratha total fighting force: ~50,000-60,000
- Suddenly lost: ~13,000 (roughly 20-25%)
- Lost: 3 important commanders

**The Cascading Effect:**
> "If some of them are leaving, then people who are fighting will question themselves as to why am I fighting? If others are leaving, it has the dynamics of its own."

When important commanders flee, it creates:
1. Doubt in remaining soldiers
2. Rumor of defeat
3. More soldiers fleeing
4. Momentum toward collapse

---

## The Timing

**The Battle Duration:**
- Started: ~8-9 AM
- Morning dominance (Maratha): 9 AM - 12 PM
- Afternoon crisis: 12 PM - 3 PM
- Mass desertion: ~3 PM onward
- Battle effectively over: ~6:30-7 PM (winter darkness)

**Total: ~9-10 hours of continuous battle**

With 200,000+ people engaged.

---

## Bhau's Strategic Error

**The Larger Mistake:**
Bhau was not as experienced as Abdali:
- Brave warrior ✓
- Good fighter ✓
- Strategic commander ✗

**The Specific Error:**
> "He got into the battlefield himself like he's a soldier. That's not what you should be doing when you're commander-in-chief."

- Dismounted from elephant
- Got on horse
- Entered direct combat
- Got wounded
- Lost command authority
- Couldn't control the collapsing situation

**The Personality Issue:**
"He was very hot-headed. Couldn't control himself."

Warrior instinct overrode commander instinct.

## Key Insights

**The Defector Gambit:**
Recruiting 2,000 defectors seemed smart. But they were never loyal. They were waiting for chaos. One visible sign of defeat (Vishwas Rao dying) and they flipped. Numbers don't matter if they're not committed.

**The Information Vacuum:**
Soldiers couldn't verify rumors. So they believed them. Rumor: Afghans in rear = panic. Reality: only defectors. But who knew?

**The Commander Cascade:**
When one commander flees, it triggers others. Vittal leaves → Damaji follows → soldiers of both follow → Holkar sees collapse → leaves with safe passage (negotiated with enemy!).

**Holkar's Pragmatism:**
He had pre-negotiated safe passage with Najib Khan. Shows: Holkar was hedging his bets. Knew battle might go south. Had escape plan. Executed it professionally.

**The Snowball Effect:**
Morning: 75,000 Marathas winning. Afternoon: 62,000 Marathas losing. Not because of tactics, but because 13,000 left (or were tied down by defectors attacking rear).

---

**Where We Left Off:** By 3-4 PM, Maratha collapse accelerating. Defectors attacking rear. Three major commanders fled with 13,000 soldiers. Remaining forces demoralizing. Battle still ongoing (continues until dark ~7 PM) but outcome already decided. Maratha momentum reversed completely.

---

*By 3 o'clock in the afternoon, everything fell apart. Vishwas Rao was dead. Bhau was wounded. The defectors Marathas had recruited threw off their turbans and started killing supply staff. Rumors of Afghans in the rear spread like fire. Vittal Shivadev looked around, saw chaos, decided he was leaving. Took 5,000 soldiers. Damaji Gayakwar, wounded and following Shivadev, took another 3,000-4,000. Malhar Rao Holkar, who'd never believed in this battle, had already negotiated safe passage with Najib Khan Rohila (the enemy!) and slipped away with 6,000. In the space of an hour, 13,000 soldiers vanished. Not killed. Just left. And when soldiers see commanders leaving, they figure if it's good enough for the boss, it's good enough for them. That's when the rout became inevitable.*
