# The Panipat Crisis: Supply Lines & Strategic Breakdown
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Maratha Supply Crisis

**The Core Problem:**
- Maratha camp at Panipat held ~100,000 people + animals
- Afghan forces under Abdali had besieged them
- Delhi was blocked to the south (under Abdali's control)
- No credit available—suppliers demanded cash only in uncertain conditions

**The Cash Solution:**
- Marathas melted down gold, silver, ornaments, and utensils
- Minted coins: Bhau Shahi, Malhar Shahi, Janko Shahi (named after three commanders)
- Used these coins to purchase grains and supplies
- Temporary fix, but limited by available bullion

**Govindpant Bundele's Mission:**
- Sent to Doab (land between Yamuna and Ganga rivers)
- Task: Collect grains and send to Bhau's camp
- Had 6,000-7,000 soldiers under his command
- Free movement because all major forces were at Panipat

## The Doab Strategy: Choking Abdali's Supplies

**The Geography:**
- Doab = fertile land between Yamuna and Ganga rivers
- Contained many granaries (productive farmland)
- Main supply hub: Mirath (town supplying Abdali's camp)

**Bundele's Success:**
- Attacked the Mirath supply route
- Effectively "choked up" Abdali's supply lines
- Caused inflation in Abdali's camp
- Created panic among Afghan allies (who worried about their homes being destroyed)

**The Counter-Response:**
- Abdali received reinforcements: Atai Khan arrived from Kabul with 10,000 fresh soldiers
- Abdali Prime Minister Shahawali Khan ordered Atai Khan to stop Bundele
- Sent Nazib Khan to guide Atai Khan to Bundele's location
- Strategic decision: Use new troops immediately rather than let supply lines fail

## The Bundele Ambush & Death (December 20, 1760)

**The Deception:**
- Jeta Gujar (local landlord) was supposed to deliver tribute to Bundele at Qaziabad
- Instead, he informed Abdali of Bundele's exact location
- Atai Khan's force crossed Yamuna near Baghpat (December 17-18)
- Approached flying Maratha commander's flag to look like friendly forces

**The Attack:**
- Bundele's army thought approaching force was Maratha reinforcement
- Only recognized it as Afghan when too close
- Atai Khan: 10,000+ fresh soldiers (numerically superior, well-rested)
- Bundele: 7,000 soldiers (spread thin, not battle-ready)

**Bundele's Fate:**
- Surprised while doing daily chores
- Attempted to flee on horseback
- Couldn't mount horse in time (he was elderly)
- Colleagues twice tried to help him but Afghans were too close
- Left behind as others fled
- Beheaded after 30 years of service to the Peshwa
- Head sent first to Nazib Khan, then to Abdali (December 22)

## Strategic Consequences

**Maratha Plan Collapses:**
- Bundele was the "last resort" to starve Abdali's camp
- His death ends the Doab starvation strategy
- Without Bundele's interference, Abdali's supplies are secure
- Inflation in Afghan camp will subside

**The Maratha Position Weakens:**
- Bhau's last viable strategy to weaken Abdali is gone
- Afghan supply lines intact
- Maratha forces remain under supply stress (limited cash from melted coins)
- Pressure on Marathas to engage in direct battle increases

---

## Historical Pattern

**Echo of Sikandarabad:**
- Malhar Rao Holkar was previously surprised by Abdali at Sikandarabad
- Was waiting for treasure delivery when attacked
- Now same trap sprung on Bundele
- Showed Afghan strategy: strike unprepared targets with surprise

## Key Insights

**The Supply Problem:**
Marathas solved short-term cash crisis by minting coins but created long-term vulnerability. Only works if they can maintain the siege or force a favorable battle soon.

**Bundele's Significance:**
Despite being older and not primarily a fighter, Bundele was crucial to the Maratha strategy. His absence exposed how dependent they were on specific individuals.

**Abdali's Flexibility:**
Rather than defend passively, Abdali immediately moved reinforcements to counter the threat. Fresh troops from Kabul showed he had reserve capacity.

**Jeta Gujar's Betrayal:**
Local landlord switched sides opportunistically—showed Marathas couldn't control even their ostensible territory. Doab inhabitants neutral at best, hostile at worst.

---

**Where We Left Off:** With Bundele dead, the Maratha strategy of starving Abdali is finished. Their supply situation remains precarious. Bhau must now consider direct confrontation. The siege mentality is breaking down. Both sides are moving toward the decisive battle.

*Bundele did what few men could do—he successfully strangled Abdali's supply lines from 1500 kilometers away. But age caught up with him when Abdali finally decided to stop playing defense. One old commander, thirty years of service, gone in an ambush. And with him went the Maratha's best chance to win without fighting. Now the armies would have to settle it on the field.*
