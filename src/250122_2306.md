# The Ally Crisis & Loan Refusals (April-May 1760)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Challenge of Finding Allies

### The Situation

**The Reality:**
> "It was not easy to find allies in the north."

**Why:**
- Lot of parties **agreed not** because of his intervention
- Or his reasons
- But people **earlier** had created those situations
- Because: this was his **first time** in north

---

## How Bhau Dealt with the Challenges

### His Strategy

**The Approach:**
> "He dealt with this challenge of signing up allies, shortage of manpower and shortage of funds in the sense that he told his people in the north to create conditions and situations where how these issues can be solved."

**What He Did:**
- Asked for **possible solutions**
- Gave **directions**
- Delegated problem-solving
- To people who knew north better

---

## The Double Demand on Govind Pant Bundele

### Both Money and Bridge

**The Money Shortage Issue:**
- Because of money shortage
- Asked **Bundeli**
- Demanded him to provide:
  1. **Boats** or boat bridge (along Yamuna River) - already asked
  2. **Money** - make provision for the money

**The Clarification:**
- Building bridge: one thing
- But just to take care of all **finances** too
- Along with boats/boat bridge
- Also: "I need money funds"
- "Just work on it generally"

**Why Him:**
- He was his **main man**
- He was a **revenue officer**
- His job

---

## Nana Sahib's Support Letters

### The Directive

**What Nana Sahib Did:**
- Sent letters to:
  - **Govind Pant**
  - All the **Subhidars** (provincial administrators)
- Help Bahu in **every way possible**
- In addition to money issues
- Meaning: providing him **funds** as well
- But also just **other support**

---

## The Nizam Request: Join the Campaign

### The Logic

**What Nana Sahib Did:**
- Insisted with **Nizam**
- To go with Bahu to the north

**The Reasoning:**
> "Here is the crux. Nizam was the kind of Mughal emperor's ally or his henchman in the south."

**Nizam's Claim:**
- Telling other people: "I'm the protector of Mughal empire in the south"
- Even though: by then becoming more independent
- During Aurangzeb or right after
- Nizam said: "I'm your vassal, I'm part of you"
- But slowly: as Mughal emperor weakening
- Started asserting **independence** from Mughal Emperor

**But Still:**
- Still **allied** with Mughal emperor by definition
- Kind of created out of extension of him

### The Argument

**Nana Sahib's Logic:**
- Marathas going to north **technically**
- Because of **1752 treaty** with Mughal emperor
- To support and protect Mughal empire
- That is why going north
- Not because they thought [other reasons]

**Therefore:**
> "Technically, Nizam should accompany because he also was working towards as an ally of, you know, like Vasaal of the Mughal emperor. So his job was to support Mughal emperor."

**The Honor Question:**
> "This was just a question of honor, you have to support your Mughal."

---

## Nizam's Refusal

### The Real Reason

**Why He Wouldn't Go:**
> "Basically, Nizam worked on the principle of, Marathas are Hindus, so I'm not going to help them. I'm going to work. I mean, he was a Muslim Jihadi."

**His Calculation:**
- Not going to help Marathas
- If Marathas **defeated or destroyed** by Abdali
- **So much better**
- Wasn't going to fight for their sake

**The Response:**
- Politely **declined**
- Said: "No, I have blah, blah, blah to do"
- But would **not** have gone
- It was in his **interest** that Marathas are destroyed
- If at all possible
- Not going to help
- No way

---

## The Ghoshla of Nagpur: Didn't Happen

### The Possibility

**Who He Was:**
- From **Nagpur**
- Had his own little **independent kingdom**
- Worked with the Peshwa
- Part of **Maratha Empire** actually
- Like a **separate wing**

**The Connection:**
- **Shivaji's** last name also was **Ghoshla**
- So they were kind of still **allied**

**The Outcome:**
- He **possibly** could have joined
- But ultimately it **didn't happen**
- Were maybe busy
- Or didn't have enough resources

---

## The Loan Crisis: When Abdali Stays

### The Turning Point

**When It Became Apparent:**
> "When it became apparent to the moneylenders and all those people that Abdali is likely to stay in India over the summer."

### The Refusal

**What Happened:**
> "So they declined to give big loans to the Maratha army or Nalasaheb Peshwa."

**Why:**
- Didn't want to be potentially backing the **loser**
- Or if Abdali comes to them
- Says "give me the money"
- And they gave it all to Marathas
- Problem

---

## The Math of the Loans

### If Abdali Left

**The Calculation:**
- If Abdali was **not** going to stay
- Then Maratha army under Sadashiv Rao Bhau
- Winning over [opponents]
- **Success rate goes high up**

**Why:**
- If Abdali going to go back
- Marathas going to go to north
- Get rid of **Rohilas**
- Get rid of **every single opponent**
- Every **Jihadi force** out there
- More likely to get **return on investment**
- No big opposition

**The Size Factor:**
- Maratha force was very, very **big**
- Any Rohilas would have been **murdered** in few days
- **Finished**
- Over
- They just didn't stand a chance

### If Abdali Stays

**The New Calculation:**
- But if Abdali going to be **principal opponent**
- Then you **don't know** what will happen
- Maybe Marathas will win
- Or maybe they will **lose**
- Then it becomes **50-50**

**The Risk:**
- Don't want to lose money on that **gamble**

**The Realization:**
> "Once they realized that Abdali is staying for this monsoon or summer, they didn't want no part in funding the Marathas."

---

## The Wait-and-See Strategy

### What Moneylenders Did

**The Decision:**
> "So they rather decided to wait on the fence and see who wins this battle because this was going to be a big battle."

**The Calculation:**
- No risk (wait)
- Too risky (lend now)

**The Pattern:**
- Like Rajputs saying same thing
- Like Suraj Mal saying
- "Sit on throne in Delhi" (first)
- They were all saying
- "I need to know which side is going to win"

**The Reality:**
> "And nobody knew for sure unless until the war takes place or the battle takes place."

---

## The Victor Problem

### The Strategy

**What They Decided:**
> "Because they were going to go on the side of the victor, the shortage of money problem was never solved in the Maratha camp."

**The Terms:**
- **Jeta** = the victor
- **Jinkne** = to win
- Going to go with **Jeta** (victor)

**The Problem:**
- Now don't know who victor will be
- Very close
- Who could tell
- Knew it was **epic battle**
- Whatever happens: not going to be small
- **Enormous violence**
- **Enormous bloodshed**

---

## The March Timeline

### The Progress

**April 14:**
- Started from **Udgir** (or Patadur)

**March 18:**
- Reached **Sindhakaid**
- Just **four days later**

**April 4:**
- Passes **Burhanpur** (or Barhanpur)

**April 12:**
- Crosses **Narmada**
- Eight days later from Burhanpur

**April 18:**
- Passes [location]

**April 24:**
- Goes to **Sehore**

**April 28:**
- Goes to **Bedsia**

---

## The Burhanpur Gateway

### The Importance

**Historical Significance:**
- Before Aurangzeb came to Dakhan
- **Burhanpur** was the area up to which
- Mughals could keep coming
- Without any issue at all

**Why:**
- Then there was Malik south of there
- Then on they had to be careful

**Aurangzeb's Change:**
- Because very determined personality
- Came all the way to **Aurangabad**
- Which is **south** of Burhanpur
- So he kind of **broke through** for first time
- Made Aurangabad capital of Mughal empire in south

**After Aurangzeb:**
- During his reign
- Aurangabad (quite south of Burhanpur)
- Became center of Mughal power
- Burhanpur was not a problem
- But originally: Burhanpur was **gateway to Dakhan**
- Aurangzeb basically broke through

---

## The Narmada Crossing: Easy in Summer

### The Question

**The Point to Understand:**
- Narmada crossed just within **matter of weeks**
- Narmada is fairly **broad and big river**
- So how did he do it?

### The Answer

**The Timing:**
> "Remember, this was the middle of summer. So the water was kind of lying low. If it was Mansoon, it would be another story."

**Why It Worked:**
- Right time of year
- His army was **massive**
- But because **summertime**
- Probably water very **shallow**
- Not a problem to cross it

**The Implication:**
> "But now see what is happening to him once Mansoon hit."

**The Contrast:**
- How Mansoon and summer river crossings are different
- Summer: easy
- Monsoon: disaster

---

## The Loan Collection

### At Srirang

**What He Collected:**
- Cashed **four lakhs** (400,000) worth of loans
- **Vathavne** = to cash
- Basically a loan you can collect

---

## Nana Fadnavis: The Survivor

### Who He Was

**His Role:**
- Administrative personality
- Not a fighter per se
- Can call: **accountant** come **diplomat** come **lawyer**
- Something like that

**His Fate:**
> "By the way, Nana Fadnavis came back from Panipat battle. He survived."

**The Miracle:**
- He somehow could come back
- That was a **miracle** in itself
- Very few people came back alive
- Because even if [survived battle]
- Have to come all the way south
- Very impressive

---

## Nana Fadnavis's Letter from Srirang

### The Contact Report

**What He Wrote:**
> "He wrote back to Peshwa that we have a contact at Suja Uddhavla."

**What This Meant:**
- There is a way
- Or a **medium**
- Through which we can start **conversation** with Suja-ud-Daula

**Why It Matters:**
- If you want to talk to somebody
- Who is relatively **unknown** to you
- You need a **middle man**
- Suja is not super close with them
- Need an **intermediary**
- And he says: **"We have somebody like that"**

---

## The Abdali Leaving Rumor

### The False Hope

**What Nana Fadnavis Said:**
- **Pathan** = referring to Abdali
- **Pathan** is a tribe in Afghanistan
- Afghanistan is tribal society even today
- **Vadanta** = a rumor

**The Message:**
> "There is a rumor that Abdali who belongs to the Pathan tribe, there is a rumor that he is going to go back in the summer months."

**The Intent:**
- Painting a **positive picture**
- Saying: maybe there won't be any battle at all

**The Reality:**
> "But that was wrong. He just probably got the wrong information or he just, I don't know. But it was not what Abdali was planning anyway."

---

## The Persistent Rumor

### The Pattern

**What Kept Happening:**
> "So this kind of references were coming again and again in the correspondence."

**The Reality:**
- Nobody really knew
- What is intention of Abdali
- Whether he wanted to **stick around** in summer months
- Or going to go back

**The Hope:**
- Kind of depending on **rumors**
- That he's going to go back
- In summer months

**The Truth:**
> "That was not really happening. They weren't going to get that lucky."

---

## Geographic Context

**The Route:**
- **Udgir/Patadur** → starting point
- **Sindhakaid** → 4 days away
- **Burhanpur** → gateway to Dakhan historically
- **Narmada River** → crossed in summer (easy)
- **Sehore** → continuing north
- **Bedsia** → continuing north
- **Srirang** → where cashed 400k loans

**Historical Geography:**
- **Burhanpur** → originally Mughal limit
- **Aurangabad** → Aurangzeb broke through, made capital
- **Dakhan/Deccan** → south of Burhanpur

---

## Financial Details

**Loans Cashed:**
- 400,000 rupees at Srirang
- **Vathavne** = to cash

**Loans Refused:**
- Moneylenders declined "big loans"
- Once Abdali staying became apparent
- Too risky
- 50-50 chance
- Would rather wait and see

**The Math:**
- If Abdali left: Marathas sure win (would lend)
- If Abdali stays: 50-50 (won't lend)
- Will go with victor after battle
- No risk strategy

---

## Major Themes

### 1. The First-Timer Disadvantage

**The Reality:**
> "This was his first time in north."

**The Problems:**
- Not easy to find allies
- Situations created by others earlier
- Not because of his intervention
- Inherited problems
- No relationships
- No knowledge

**The Delegation:**
- Told people in north
- Create solutions
- Because they know better
- He doesn't

### 2. The Double Burden on Govind Pant

**What He's Asked:**
1. Build boat bridge (major engineering)
2. Solve money problem (major finance)

**The Reality:**
- Two critical tasks
- Both must succeed
- Campaign depends on both
- All on one 60+ year old man
- Revenue officer
- Not miracle worker

**The Pressure:**
- Bhau's "main man"
- Everything depends on him
- Bridge or no advance
- Money or no campaign
- Too much on one person

### 3. The Nizam Honor Trap

**The Logic:**
- Nizam is Mughal vassal
- Marathas protecting Mughal empire
- Therefore: Nizam should join
- Question of **honor**

**The Reality:**
- Nizam is **Muslim Jihadi**
- Marathas are Hindu
- Not going to help
- Wants them **destroyed**
- Politely declines
- Never going

**The Contrast:**
- What should happen (honor)
- What actually happens (religion)
- Honor < ideology
- Logic doesn't matter
- Religious identity wins

### 4. The 50-50 Calculation

**Before Abdali Stays:**
- Marathas vs Rohilas only
- Marathas **huge** force
- Would **murder** them in days
- **Sure win**
- Safe to lend

**After Abdali Stays:**
- Marathas vs Abdali
- Don't know what happens
- **50-50**
- Too risky
- Won't lend

**The Impact:**
- Money dries up
- Shortage never solved
- Because of uncertainty
- Because of Abdali
- Financial strategy collapses

### 5. The Wait-and-See Conspiracy

**Who's Doing It:**
- Moneylenders
- Rajputs
- Suraj Mal (kind of)
- Everyone

**The Strategy:**
- Wait on fence
- See who wins
- Then join victor
- No risk

**The Problem for Marathas:**
- No allies now
- No money now
- When need it most
- Before battle
- Everyone waiting
- To see outcome

**The Irony:**
- Waiting to see who wins
- But their waiting affects who wins
- By not supporting
- They make Maratha loss more likely
- Self-fulfilling prophecy

### 6. The Summer Window

**The Advantage:**
- Narmada crossed easily
- Matter of weeks
- Water low
- Shallow
- No problem

**The Timing:**
- Middle of summer
- Right time of year
- If monsoon: disaster
- But summer: easy

**The Foreshadowing:**
> "But now see what is happening to him once Mansoon hit."

**The Pattern:**
- Summer crossings: easy
- Monsoon crossings: impossible
- Took one month for Gambhir (monsoon)
- Took weeks for Narmada (summer)
- Season matters hugely

### 7. The Epic Battle Everyone Knows

**The Consensus:**
- Everyone knew
- Epic battle coming
- Enormous violence
- Enormous bloodshed
- Not going to be small

**The Preparation:**
- Moneylenders: wait
- Allies: wait
- Everyone: wait
- See who survives
- Then decide

**The Inevitability:**
- Can't avoid it
- Can't negotiate it
- Going to happen
- Going to be massive
- Everyone preparing
- By staying out

### 8. The Rumor Dependency

**The Pattern:**
- References coming **again and again**
- In correspondence
- Abdali might leave
- Maybe no battle
- False hope

**The Reality:**
- Wrong information
- Or wishful thinking
- Not Abdali's plan
- He's staying
- But rumors persist

**The Danger:**
- Planning based on rumors
- Not reality
- Hoping for miracle
- Instead of preparing for war
- Dangerous optimism

### 9. The Contact with Suja

**What Nana Fadnavis Reports:**
- Have contact/intermediary
- With Suja-ud-Daula
- Can start conversation
- Through middle man

**Why It Matters:**
- Suja already joined Abdali
- But not super close with him
- Maybe can be flipped
- Or at least negotiated with
- Through back channel

**The Hope:**
- Not all lost
- Still possibilities
- Still diplomatic options
- Before battle
- Maybe can change outcome

### 10. The Survivor's Report

**Nana Fadnavis:**
- Survived Panipat
- **Miracle**
- Very few came back
- Had to make it all way south
- Very impressive

**His Role:**
- Administrator
- Not fighter
- Accountant/diplomat/lawyer type
- Sent this letter

**The Implication:**
- Administrative types survive
- By not being in thick of battle
- By being smart
- By escaping when needed
- Fighters die
- Administrators live

---

## Critical Insights

### The Ally Desert

**The Reality:**
> "It was not easy to find allies in the north."

**Why:**
- First time there
- No relationships
- Inherited bad situations
- Created by Shinde/Holkar
- Rajputs alienated
- Muslims hostile
- Everyone waiting

**The Delegation:**
- Bhau doesn't know north
- So tells northerners
- "Create solutions"
- "How to solve these issues"
- Because he can't

**The Problem:**
- But they don't have solutions either
- No one wants to commit
- Until battle decided
- Catch-22
- Need allies to win
- But get allies only if win

### The Govind Pant Impossibility

**The Tasks:**
1. Build boat bridge over Yamuna
   - Major engineering
   - Need boats
   - Need construction
   - Need time
   - Under threat
2. Solve money problem
   - Need to collect revenue
   - From hostile areas
   - Under time pressure
   - While moving

**The Man:**
- 60+ years old
- Revenue officer
- Not engineer
- Not magician
- Just administrator

**The Math:**
- Two impossible tasks
- One person
- Both critical
- Both must succeed
- Or campaign fails
- Unrealistic expectations

### The Honor vs Reality Schism

**The Honor Argument:**
- Nizam is Mughal vassal
- Marathas protecting Mughals
- 1752 treaty
- Therefore: Nizam should join
- Matter of honor
- Support your emperor

**The Reality Check:**
- Nizam is Muslim
- Marathas are Hindu
- He's a **Jihadi**
- Wants them destroyed
- Religion > treaties
- Ideology > honor

**The Pattern:**
- Appealing to honor
- When religion matters more
- Appealing to treaties
- When identity matters more
- Logic fails
- Because wrong framework

### The Loan Mathematics

**The Calculation Before:**
- Marathas vs Rohilas
- Rohilas: weak
- Marathas: 70,000+ soldiers
- Would be "murdered in days"
- "Finished"
- "Over"
- Safe bet
- Would lend

**The Calculation After:**
- Marathas vs Abdali
- Abdali: proven force
- Marathas: uncertain
- 50-50 outcome
- "Don't want to lose money on that gamble"
- Too risky
- Won't lend

**The Swing:**
- From sure thing
- To coin flip
- Just by Abdali staying
- Changes entire financial picture
- No more loans
- Shortage permanent

### The Fence-Sitting Strategy

**Everyone Doing It:**
- Moneylenders: "wait and see"
- Rajputs: "wait and see"
- Suraj Mal: "sit on throne first"
- Pattern

**The Logic:**
- Why risk now?
- Battle decides everything
- Join victor after
- No risk
- Maximum gain

**For Marathas:**
- Need support now
- Before battle
- That's when it matters
- After battle: too late

**The Irony:**
- Everyone waiting for outcome
- But their waiting affects outcome
- By not supporting Marathas
- Make Maratha defeat more likely
- Then join Abdali after
- Self-fulfilling

### The Summer Mirage

**The Easy Crossing:**
- Narmada: "matter of weeks"
- Summer: water low
- Shallow
- No problem

**The False Confidence:**
- Looks easy
- Because right season
- But Gambhir took one month (monsoon)
- Seasonal
- Not permanent

**The Foreshadowing:**
> "But now see what is happening to him once Mansoon hit."

**The Reality:**
- Summer advantage temporary
- Monsoon coming
- Will reverse everything
- Rivers will flood
- Crossing impossible
- Temporary success

### The Epic Battle Consensus

**What Everyone Knew:**
- Going to be **epic**
- **Enormous violence**
- **Enormous bloodshed**
- Not small skirmish
- Decisive battle

**The Response:**
- Moneylenders: wait
- Allies: wait
- Everyone: stay out
- Watch from distance
- Join winner after

**The Implication:**
- Battle so big
- So decisive
- So violent
- Better to avoid
- Better to wait
- Let them destroy each other
- Pick up pieces after

### The Rumor Addiction

**The Pattern:**
- "Again and again"
- In correspondence
- Abdali might leave
- Maybe no battle
- Hope springs eternal

**The Psychology:**
- Wanting it to be true
- So believing rumors
- Despite evidence
- Despite pattern change
- Wishful thinking

**The Danger:**
- Planning based on hope
- Not reality
- Not preparing for actual war
- Preparing for hoped-for peace
- Setting up for shock
- When battle comes

### The Intermediary Hope

**The Contact:**
- With Suja-ud-Daula
- Through middleman
- Can start conversation
- Diplomatic channel

**The Dream:**
- Maybe flip him
- Back to Maratha side
- Or at least neutralize
- Reduce Abdali's force
- Change balance

**The Reality:**
- Suja already committed
- Under Abdali's eye
- Trapped in his camp
- Can't leave
- Too late
- But hope persists

### The Administrator Survives

**The Pattern:**
- **Nana Fadnavis**: survives
- Administrative type
- Not fighter
- Accountant/diplomat
- Lives through Panipat

**The Lesson:**
- Fighters die
- Heroes die
- Commanders die
- Administrators survive
- By not being in front
- By escaping smartly
- Survival > glory

**The Application:**
- Those who survive tell story
- Those who die don't
- History written by survivors
- Usually not the heroes

---

## What's Coming

**The Situation:**
- Can't find allies (first time in north)
- Govind Pant given two impossible tasks
- Nizam refused (wants Marathas destroyed)
- Ghoshla didn't join
- Moneylenders refuse loans (Abdali staying)
- Everyone waiting to see who wins
- Money shortage never solved
- Rumors persist (false hope)
- Contact with Suja (too late?)
- Epic battle everyone knows is coming

**The Questions:**
1. Can Govind Pant do the impossible?
2. Will any allies materialize?
3. Will moneylenders change their minds?
4. Can they flip Suja?
5. Where will money come from?
6. How to fight without allies or funds?

**The Trajectory:**
- Allies: none materializing
- Money: drying up
- Support: everyone waiting
- Hope: based on rumors
- Reality: heading to massive battle
- Without resources
- Without allies
- Without funds
- Disaster looming

---

**Spring 1760: It's not easy to find allies in the north. This is his first time. People earlier created these situations - Shinde, Holkar alienating everyone. So Bhau tells his people: create solutions, I don't know this place. Govind Pant Bundele gets hit with both impossible tasks: build the boat bridge AND solve the money problem. He's 60+ years old. Nana Sahib tries to get Nizam to join: "You're Mughal vassal, we're protecting Mughals, matter of honor." Nizam's response: polite decline. Why? "He was a Muslim Jihadi." Wants Marathas destroyed. Not helping. No way. Then the loan crisis: when it became apparent Abdali is staying, moneylenders declined to give big loans. The math changed. Before: Marathas vs Rohilas = sure win = safe to lend. After: Marathas vs Abdali = 50-50 = too risky. "Don't want to lose money on that gamble." Everyone waiting on the fence. Moneylenders, Rajputs, everyone. Wait and see who wins. Then join the victor. No risk. But for Marathas? The shortage of money problem was never solved. Narmada crossed easily - summer, water low, no problem. But rumors keep coming: maybe Abdali will leave, maybe no battle. Wrong. "They weren't going to get that lucky." Nana Fadnavis sends letter: we have contact with Suja. Maybe there's hope. But everyone knows: epic battle coming. Enormous violence. Enormous bloodshed. Better wait. See who survives. Then decide.**
