## The Price of Power: Buying the Wazir Position

| Option | Price | Who Gets It |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Option 1** | 1 crore rupees | Imad ul-Mulk can keep Wazir position |
| **Option 2** | 2 crore rupees | Najib Khan becomes new Wazir |

**The Choice:**
> "Pay me 1 crore and stay as Wazir. Or Najib will pay 2 crores and take your job. Your choice."

### Najib's Bid

**The Outcome:**
- **Najib Khan paid 2 crore rupees**
- He got the **Wazir position**
- Put in charge of Delhi's administration (कारभार)
- His dream realized - he's now effectively running the Mughal Empire

**Why He Paid More:**

- This was his master plan all along
- Knew it was worth it
- Would extract more than 2 crores from the position

---

## The Ultimate Humiliation: Prayers in Abdali's Name

### The Symbolic Victory

**What Normally Happened:**
- Public prayers always said in the **Mughal Emperor's name**
- This showed who was the real ruler
- Traditional sign of sovereignty

**What Changed:**
- Even though the Mughal Emperor was still alive
- Prayers were now said in **Abdali's name** in Delhi
- Not the Emperor's name
- Showed who the real boss was

**The Message:**
> "I don't need to kill the Emperor. Everyone will pray in MY name anyway. That's real power."

---

## The Red Fort Evacuation

### Abdali Takes the Imperial Palace

**What Happened:**
- It became clear Abdali was going to enter the **Red Fort** (Lal Qila)
- The Mughal Emperor realized this
- **The Emperor left the Red Fort voluntarily**
- Just walked out
- Abdali didn't even have to force him

### Why Abdali Didn't Depose Him

**The Calculation:**
- Abdali **did not sack** (पदच्युत) the Mughal Emperor
- Could have easily done so
- But chose not to

**His Reasoning:**

1. **Wanted stability** - not chaos
2. **The Emperor was just a toy** - a puppet
3. **If I replace him, the new guy will also be a toy**
4. **Why bother?** As long as he's compliant
5. **He's my neighbor** (and Muslim)
6. **No personal enmity** - just business
7. **As long as he does my bidding, who cares?**

**The Philosophy:**
> "Why change toys when this one works fine?"

**The Only Change:**
- Kicked out Imad ul-Mulk as Wazir
- Installed Najib Khan instead
- That's all the reform needed

---

## The Entry into Delhi

### The Ghost Town

**The Fear:**
- When Abdali entered Delhi, people were **terrified**
- Based on previous experiences
- Everyone knew his reputation

**The Reaction:**
- People **hid in their houses**
- Streets were **near Manushya** (without people)
- Like a ghost town
- Empty streets as he rode through
- Via these deserted streets, he entered the Red Fort

### The Public Announcement

**Abdali's Promise:**
- Told the people of Delhi:
> "You don't have any reason to be afraid. You won't be harmed."

- Guaranteed their safety
- Wanted them to continue normal business
- Didn't like that they hid from him

---

## The Brutal Examples: Punishing the Mughal Soldiers

### The Torture as Message

**Who Was Targeted:**
- Mughal soldiers who were **not compliant**
- Those who resisted or caused trouble
- Those who wouldn't cooperate

**The Punishments (from historical records):**

1. **Nose mutilation** - Cut off their noses
2. **Disembowelment** - Dug into them and took intestines out
3. **Public humiliation** - Put something in their nose (to mark them)
4. **Parade through Delhi** - Put them on donkeys and toured them through the city
5. **Made examples** - So everyone could see

**The Effect:**
- Every single Mughal soldier was "straightened out"
- Anyone misbehaving before stopped immediately
- Got the message: severe punishment for non-compliance
- Regular people were also "scaredy cats" - terrified
- Nobody wanted to risk punishment

---

## The Systematic Looting Begins

### Target #1: Imad ul-Mulk Himself

**The Confiscation:**
- Imad was obviously a rich man (former Wazir)
- All his gold confiscated
- All his silver taken
- All his ornaments seized
- Everything precious that he owned

**But It Wasn't Enough:**
- Abdali expected MORE from Imad
- Where's the rest?
- Since he didn't have it (or said he didn't)
- He was **insulted in front of his servants**
- Public humiliation

### Imad's Claim of Ignorance

**His Defense:**
> "I don't know about Mughalani Begum's letter. I have no idea that she wrote to you about hidden wealth in Delhi. I don't know where wealth is buried."

**Translation:**
- "Maybe it's fake"
- "Not my thing"  
- "I can't help you find it"

**Abdali's Response:**
- Didn't believe him at all
- Suspected he was lying
- Threatened him

### The Threat

**Abdali's Warning:**
> "If you don't tell me where the wealth is hidden, I will give you slashes in the public square."

**Translation:**
- Public whipping/beating
- Severe physical punishment
- In front of everyone
- Ultimate humiliation

---

## The Family Connection

### The Mehuda Problem

**Who Was Affected:**
- **Imtiaz** was Mughalani Begum's **mehuda** (sister's husband)
- He was going to be slashed publicly
- He couldn't (or wouldn't) talk about hidden wealth

**Mughalani's Dilemma:**
- She felt **sympathetic** to her relative
- Became very disturbed
- Changed her mind about the torture

**Her Intervention:**
- Asked Imad ul-Mulk to join her
- Together they went to Abdali
- **Pleaded:** "Please pardon this guy. He really doesn't know anything."

---

## Abdali's Inflexible Response

### No Mercy

**Why He Refused:**
- Had to get **tremendous amount of wealth** out of Delhi
- **His quota was not complete**
- Suspected these people were lying
- Believed the wealth was hidden and they wouldn't give it willingly

**His Philosophy:**
> "Whether it's good way or bad way, I have to get the wealth. I will use good means or bad means, but I have to get the wealth. Everything else is secondary."

**The Reality:**
- He'd squeeze them until they gave up everything
- No sympathy
- No flexibility
- The mission was wealth extraction, nothing else

---

## The Torture Methods

### Making Examples

**Why Public Torture:**
1. **Intimidation** - Make everyone else compliant
2. **Information extraction** - Force people to reveal wealth locations
3. **Punishment** - For those who resisted
4. **Control** - Show who's really in charge

**The Specific Techniques:**
- Mutilation (nose cutting)
- Disembowelment
- Public marking
- Humiliation parades
- Threats of worse

**The Message:**
> "This is what happens to those who don't cooperate. Everyone else, comply or face the same."

---

## The Wealth Extraction Strategy

### Abdali's Method

**The Steps:**

1. **Confiscate obvious wealth** - Gold, silver, jewels from rich people's homes
2. **Demand information** - Where is the buried treasure?
3. **Apply pressure** - Threats first
4. **Use torture** - If they don't comply
5. **Public punishment** - Make examples
6. **Extract everything** - Until quota is met

**The Targets:**
- Former Wazir (Imad)
- His relatives (Imtiaz)
- All rich Mansabdars
- Courtiers
- Anyone suspected of hidden wealth

**The Quota System:**
- Abdali had a **target amount** in mind
- "His quota was not complete"
- Would keep going until satisfied
- No mercy until goal achieved

---

## Key Themes

1. **Surrender Without Battle** - Imad knew he couldn't win
2. **Buying Power** - Najib paid for the Wazir position
3. **Symbolic Victories** - Prayers in Abdali's name, taking Red Fort
4. **Puppet Rulers** - Emperor kept alive but powerless
5. **Public Terror** - Brutal punishments as examples
6. **Systematic Extraction** - Methodical wealth confiscation
7. **Good Cop/Bad Cop** - Promise safety, but punish severely
8. **The Quota Must Be Met** - Inflexible about wealth targets
9. **Family Complications** - Even conspirators have limits when family involved
10. **Ghost Town Effect** - Fear empties the streets

---

## The Psychology of Control

### Abdali's Sophisticated Strategy

**Not Just Brute Force:**

1. **Selective Mercy:**
   - Don't kill the Emperor
   - Promise safety to citizens
   - Makes him seem reasonable

2. **Targeted Brutality:**
   - Punish soldiers specifically
   - Make public examples
   - Creates fear without mass violence

3. **Economic Extraction:**
   - Go after the wealth systematically
   - Use torture for information
   - No sentimentality

4. **Political Control:**
   - Install Najib as Wazir
   - Keep Emperor as figurehead
   - Control through puppets

**The Result:**
- Maximum wealth extraction
- Minimum resistance
- Stable enough to not collapse
- Can leave it functioning when he exits

---

## Mughalani's Dilemma

### The Limits of Revenge

**Her Arc:**
1. **Started:** Angry, betrayed, wanted revenge
2. **Middle:** Invited Abdali, revealed secrets
3. **Now:** Feeling sympathetic when family member threatened

**The Complication:**
- **Imtiaz** was her **mehuda** (sister's husband)
- Family connection making her reconsider
- But she created this situation
- Too late to stop the machine she set in motion

**The Irony:**
- She wanted Imad punished
- Now his relative (who's her relative too) is being tortured
- She pleads for mercy
- **Abdali refuses**
- She has no more control

---

## The Practical Reality

### Why People Hid Wealth

**No Banking System:**
- No safe deposit boxes
- No institutional security
- Had to hide wealth physically

**The Hiding Methods:**
- Buried in walls
- Beneath floors
- In secret rooms
- In haveli courtyards
- Anywhere they could dig

**The Problem:**
- Family members knew locations
- Under torture, people talk
- Abdali had time and no mercy
- The wealth WOULD be found

---

## Imad's Fall

### From Power to Humiliation

**His Descent:**

| Stage | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Before** | Wazir, powerful, controlling Delhi |
| **January 19** | Surrendered without fight |
| **After Surrender** | Lost Wazir position to Najib |
| **During Looting** | Wealth confiscated |
| **Lowest Point** | Insulted in front of his own servants |

**The Ultimate Humiliation:**
- Not just losing power
- Not just losing wealth
- But being **insulted in front of servants**
- Loss of face
- Loss of dignity
- Publicly shown as powerless

---

## What Comes Next

**The Setup:**
- Abdali is now in control of Delhi
- Najib Khan is Wazir
- Emperor is a puppet
- Citizens are terrified
- Wealth extraction has begun
- Torture is the tool
- No one can stop him

**The Questions:**
1. How much wealth will he extract?
2. How long will the looting continue?
3. What will happen to the Emperor long-term?
4. When will the Marathas respond?
5. What's Najib's next move as Wazir?
6. How many will be tortured?

---

## Historical Context

### Why This Matters

**The 1757 Sack of Delhi:**
- One of the major lootings in Indian history
- Showed Mughal Empire's complete collapse
- Demonstrated Abdali's ruthless efficiency
- Set pattern for future invasions
- Created power vacuum that Marathas would try to fill
- Led eventually to Panipat in 1761

**The Lesson:**
- Power without military strength is illusion
- Puppets can be useful
- Terror is a tool
- Wealth extraction requires ruthlessness
- No mercy in conquest

---

**January 1757: Imad surrenders without a fight. Najib buys the Wazir position for 2 crores. The Emperor evacuates his own palace. Prayers are said in Abdali's name. Soldiers are mutilated and paraded through empty streets. The citizens hide. The torture begins. The wealth extraction is systematic. Abdali's philosophy is clear: "Good way or bad way, I will get the wealth. Everything else is secondary." Delhi has fallen. The looting has just begun.**
