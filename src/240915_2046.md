---

## The Family Tree Clarified

**The Answer:** Safdar Jung = Mansoor Khan (same person, different titles!)

### The Lineage

**Saadat Khan:**
- First Nawab of Awadh
- Originally from Iran
- Established the dynasty

**Muhammad Mukim (Mansoor Khan):**
- Nephew of Saadat Khan (his uncle's son)

3. Warmly received by his uncle

---

## The Strategic Marriage

### The Alliance

**Who Got Married:**

- **Sadrunisa Begum** (Saadat Khan's daughter)
- Uncle's son marrying uncle's daughter (cousin marriage)

**The Title:** Abul Mansoor Khan (his first title)

**The Position:** Deputy Governor of Awadh

---

## Mansoor Khan: The Unusual Prince

### What Made Him Different

**His Monogamy:**
- **Unusual for princes of that day**
- Married **only once**
- **No mistress or concubine**
- In an era of harems and multiple wives, this was remarkable

### His Wife: Sadrunisa Begum

**Her Reputation:**
- Renowned for her **good sense**
- Later gave **good advice to her son** (Suja ud-Daula)
- On **more than one occasion**
- A thoughtful, wise woman

**Remember:** Both she and her son will play **very important roles** later.

## The Military Career: Battles with Malhar Rao Holkar

### Round 1: Mansoor Khan Wins (1737)

**The Setup:**
- Mansoor Khan fought by his father-in-law's (Saadat Khan's) side
- **Most notable success: 1737**

**What Happened:**
- Drew the **Maratha force under Malhar Rao Holkar** towards the main Mughal army
- Under Saadat Khan's command
- Won a victory
- **Holkar was chased beyond the Yamuna** towards Bajirao's camp

**Significance:** This was **before** the factional alliances formed - they were still enemies.

---

### Round 2: Holkar Gets Revenge (1738)

**The Next Year:**
- Malhar Rao got his revenge
- Stopped Mansoor Khan from going to **Nizam ul-Mulk's aid near Bhopal**

**Context Check:**
- **Nizam ul-Mulk** = ruling in Hyderabad (down south)
- Remember: Bajirao had created trouble for him before
- Now Mansoor Khan was trying to help the Nizam

**The Score:** 1-1 between Mansoor Khan and Malhar Rao Holkar

**Historical Note:** This is **1737-1738** - about **two years before Nadir Shah** invades (1739).

---

## The Succession Crisis: Saadat Khan Dies

### The Death

**When:** In the wake of Nadir Shah's attack on Delhi (1739)

**The Problem:** More than one claimant for governing the province of Awadh

**The Contestants:**
- Safdar Jung (Mansoor Khan)
- Others (multiple claimants)

---

## The Master Bribe: How to Win a Succession

### Mansoor Khan's Strategy

**What He Did:**
- Argued his case well
- **Buttressed by a cash peshkash (tribute) of TWO CRORE RUPEES** to Nadir Shah
- That's **20 MILLION RUPEES** in 1739 money 💰

**The Delivery:**
- Cash reached Delhi on **May 13, 1739**
- Escorted by **200 Qizilbash soldiers**
- Plus a special gift: **A HUGE ELEPHANT**

### Understanding the Players

**Qizilbash Soldiers:**
- Typical Persian soldiers
- Specific attire and weapons
- Iranian style
- Shows Mansoor Khan's Persian/Shia identity

**The Elephant:**
- Royal animal
- Symbol of power and wealth
- Perfect diplomatic gift

---

## Why This Bribe Worked

### The Power Dynamic in 1739

**Who Was Really in Charge:**
- Nadir Shah had just looted Delhi
- Created absolute terror
- Massacred thousands
- The Mughal Emperor was **essentially Nadir Shah's pawn**

**The Strategy:**
- Instead of giving money to his "boss" (the Mughal Emperor)
- Mansoor Khan gave it to **the real power** (Nadir Shah)
- Nadir Shah was calling the shots
- **He** would be appointing the Subedar, not the emperor

### The Shia Connection

**Why It Mattered:**
- Mansoor Khan = **Shia Muslim**
- Nadir Shah = **Shia Muslim** (from Iran)
- Same religious background
- Natural alliance

**The Calculation:**
- Presented tribute to fellow Shia who holds real power
- Showed loyalty to Iran/Persian faction
- Demonstrated wealth and capability
- Got in Nadir Shah's good graces thoroughly

---

## The Appointment: Birth of "Safdar Jung"

### What Happened

**Nadir Shah's Decision:**
- Deposited the money in his treasury
- On his departure back to Iran
- The Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah appointed Mansoor Khan as **Governor of Awadh**

### The New Title

**"Safdar Jung"** = **"Lion of Battle"** (or "Lion of War")

**Meaning:**
- Not his real name - it's an **honorific title**
- Given for his military prowess
- His actual name remained **Mansoor Khan** (or Mansoor Ali Khan)
- But he's now known as **Safdar Jung**

**Result:** No more succession tussle - Mansoor Khan/Safdar Jung wins decisively.

---

## The Next Decade: Military Campaigns (1740s)

### Following the Emperor's Orders

**What Safdar Jung Did:**
- Led expeditions on orders from the Mughal Emperor
- Campaign to **Patna** (city in Bihar province)
- Where **Nana Saheb Peshwa** had also reached on his invasion of Bengal

### The Varanasi-Gaya Situation

**The Holy Cities:**
- **Varanasi** (Kashi) - one of holiest Hindu cities
- **Gaya** - where Gautam Buddha attained salvation
- Both were under Safdar Jung's control (part of Awadh territory)

**Nana Saheb's Interest:**
- Wanted to visit these holy places
- Maratha interest: make them **independent cities**
- Free them from Mughal/Awadh control

**The Emperor's Response:**
- When Peshwa visited Varanasi and Gaya
- Emperor ordered Safdar Jung to **return to Awadh**
- Translation: "Don't bother Nana Saheb, back off"
- Smart move to avoid confrontation

---

## The Big Promotion: Moving to Delhi (1743)

### The Summons

**1743:**
- Safdar Jung was **summoned to Delhi**
- Made a **grand entry into the city**
- With lots of pomp and circumstance
- He understood he might be made **wazir**

### What He Actually Got

**The Appointments:**
1. **Head of Artillery** (Commander of cannon regiments)
2. **Governor of Kashmir**

**Not Wazir Yet** - but these are major promotions that set him up for it.

---

## Understanding the Mughal Court Factions

### The Two-Faction System

**The Split:**
1. **Irani (Persian) Group** - Shia Muslims
2. **Turani (Turkish/Central Asian) Group** - Sunni Muslims

### The Irani/Persian Faction

**Who They Were:**
- From Iran/Persia
- **Shia Muslims**
- Led by Safdar Jung (after his rise)

**Their Base:**
- Persian cultural influence
- Shia religious identity
- Support from Iran

---

### The Turani/Turkish Faction

**Who They Were:**
- From Central Asia (Turkmenistan, Turkestan, etc.)
- **NOT** modern Turkey - this is Central Asian Turks
- **Sunni Muslims**
- Led by **Kamruddin Khan** (the existing wazir)

**Their Base:**
- Afghan/Rohilla connection
- Central Asian tribes
- Sunni orthodox identity

**Important:** They have **camaraderie with Afghans** - same Sunni background, same region.

---

## The Rise of Tensions

### Who Got Displaced

**The Positions Safdar Jung Got:**
- Head of Artillery
- Governor of Kashmir
- **Previously held by Turani/Turkish loyalists**
- Loyal to wazir **Kamruddin Khan**

**The Resentment:**
- Kamruddin's faction was **not considered** (overlooked)
- They felt passed over
- Safdar Jung (a Shia) was getting prominent positions
- The Sunni/Turani faction did NOT like this

---

## The Religious Division

### Why This Mattered

**The Turani/Afghan Position:**
- All **Sunni Muslims**
- Didn't want a **Shia** getting prominent positions
- Religious rivalry between Sunni and Shia
- Felt under Safdar Jung's thumb

### The Power Play

**Nadir Shah's Influence:**
- Remember: Nadir Shah gave Safdar Jung the subedarship of Ayodhya/Awadh
- Mughal Emperor was under Nadir Shah's pressure
- Emperor gave these new appointments partly due to that influence

**The Result:**
- Created deep **rivalry** between the factions
- Rohillas/Afghans/Turanis vs. Safdar Jung and the Shia faction
- This will explode later

---

## Safdar Jung's Strategy: The Maratha Alliance

### Why the Afghans/Rohillas Were Weak

**The Realization:**
- Rohillas knew they didn't have enough power to defeat Safdar Jung
- Why? Because **Safdar Jung knew to make alliances with Marathas**
- He got their commitment to defending Delhi

**The Track Record:**
- After Safdar Jung sought Maratha help
- Marathas won **quite a few battles in and around the Doab**
- These were pitched battles against the Rohillas
- **Rohillas realized: We have NO match for Marathas**
- They're fighting a superior force

**The Consequence:**
- Rohillas in a very weak spot
- Can't defeat Safdar Jung militarily
- Can't match the Maratha alliance
- Stuck under Shia faction control

---

## The Nadir Shah Effect (1739)

### How Everything Changed

**Before Nadir Shah:**
- Mughals thought they could handle threats
- Safdar Jung and Malhar Rao were trading victories (1-1)
- Normal political/military competition

**After Nadir Shah (1739):**
- Nadir Shah created **terror** in Delhi
- Literally **massacred thousands and thousands** of people
- **A different level of cruelty**
- Even the torturous Mughals thought this was inhuman

**The Realization:**
- Mughals understood they were **incapable of dealing with external aggressors**
- This level of violence was beyond what they'd seen or done
- They couldn't take this kind of punishment

**The Result:**
- Mughals started inclining towards **Marathas** for protection
- Needed allies who could actually fight
- That's when the whole dynamic shifted

- Far north
- Safdar Jung given governorship in 1743
- Previously held by Turani loyalists

**Varanasi & Gaya:**
- Holy cities under Awadh control
- Peshwa wanted them independent
- Point of tension

**The Doab:**
- Where Marathas and Rohillas fought
- Safdar Jung's territory
- Most fertile land after Punjab

---

## Strategic Analysis

### Safdar Jung's Genius Moves

1. **Identified Real Power** - Bribed Nadir Shah, not the puppet emperor
2. **Spectacular Bribe** - 2 crore + 200 soldiers + elephant = impossible to refuse
3. **Shia Networks** - Leveraged religious connections with Iran
4. **Maratha Alliance** - Understood who the real military power was
5. **Court Politics** - Systematically displaced Turani faction from key positions

### Why the Rohillas Were Screwed

1. **Military Inferiority** - Can't beat Marathas on the battlefield
2. **Political Outmaneuvered** - Safdar Jung controls key positions
3. **Religious Isolation** - Shia faction has Iranian backing
4. **No External Allies** - Can't call on anyone strong enough
5. **Stuck** - Under Safdar Jung's thumb with no way out

---

## The Factional Dynamics

### Why This Matters for Panipat

**The Setup:**
- Court divided: Shia (Irani) vs. Sunni (Turani/Afghan)
- Safdar Jung represents Shia faction
- Rohillas/Afghans represent Sunni faction
- Marathas allied with Safdar Jung
- When Abdali comes → Sunni vs. Shia + Hindu alliance

**The Inevitable Explosion:**
- Religious tensions building
- Political resentments festering
- Rohillas feel weak and desperate
- They need an external Sunni champion
- Enter: **Ahmad Shah Abdali** (Sunni Afghan with big army)

---

## Key Themes

1. **The Power of Well-Placed Bribes** - 2 crore bought a kingdom
2. **Religious Factions Matter** - Sunni vs. Shia shapes everything
3. **Know Who Really Has Power** - Nadir Shah, not the emperor
4. **Military Alliances Are Everything** - Marathas made Safdar Jung untouchable
5. **Court Politics Is Deadly** - Displacing factions creates permanent enemies
6. **The Nadir Shah Effect** - One invasion changed the entire psychology

---

## The Irony

**Mansoor Khan:**
- Defeated Malhar Rao Holkar in 1737 (as enemies)
- Later allied with Marathas (became friends)
- This alliance made him powerful
- But also committed him to fighting Abdali
- Which will lead to...

---

**Where we left off:** The court factions are set, the tensions are rising, and everyone understands the rivalry between Shia and Sunni Muslims in the Mughal court. The Rohillas are weak and desperate, waiting for someone who can match the Maratha power...

---

*From nephew to governor to wazir - Mansoor Khan played the game perfectly. But in creating enemies of the Rohillas and Afghans, he set the stage for them to invite the one man who could challenge the Maratha-Mughal alliance: Ahmad Shah Abdali.*
