# Political Warfare & Delhi Assassinations (November-December 1759)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Politics of Battle

### Abdali's Strategic Genius

**The Core Principle:**
> "Fighting, battling and killing and all that violence is only as important as the politics of battle."

**What This Means:**
- Battle is **10%** of the final thing
- Politics is **90%**
- If you do politics properly, battle just seals the deal

**Abdali's Approach:**
- **Very, very good at political part**
- Marathas are **not good at it**
- This difference will decide everything

---

## Abdali's Letter Campaign to Madho Singh

### The Long Correspondence

**The History:**
- First letter traced back to **January 1757**
- When Abdali took over Delhi and attacked Mathura
- Madho Singh solicited support from **Prince Taimur** (Abdali's son)
- **Prolonged correspondence** continued

### November 1759: The Key Letter

**Abdali's Message to Madho Singh:**
> "Taking advantage of his absence in Persia, the Marathas had thrown the whole of Hindustan into disorder."

**The Request:**
- Urged Madho Singh to **join hands with Vijay Singh of Jodhpur**
- Stop the passage of Marathas towards the Khan (Deccan)

**Why This Is Critical:**
- Abdali knows if **Hindu powers unite**, it's tough for him
- Doesn't want **Rajputs + Marathas** alliance
- Both Hindu
- Together = very difficult union to face

**The Strategy:**
> "He wants Marathas to be sidelined into one camp and everybody else on his side."

---

## The Flattery Letter

### Abdali's False Praise

**What He Wrote:**
> "I, the Kibla of the world and of its creatures, have got in view to show favors to you and have had from times of old a soft corner in my heart for the Rajput community and have regarded them all because of the old connection as sincerely attached to my God-given kingdom."

**The Reality:**
- **He's lying**
- Doesn't give a shit about Rajputs
- Considers them kafir (infidel)
- But needs to align them against Marathas
- **Flattering them** for political purposes

**The Promise:**
> "If God so willeth, all will feel gratified by mine favors. Najib Uddawla has impressed upon me your sincerity, fidelity and devotion, and God willing, you will attain preeminence and distinction."

### Why It Works

**The Rajput Problem:**
- Marathas getting into their **internal affairs too much**
- Asking for **too many tributes**
- They couldn't afford to pay
- Feeling **violated, irate, angry, upset**
- Happening **too often, very frequently**
- Couldn't be allowed to pass

**The Desperation:**
- **Only power that could help** = Abdali
- No single power in India could help them
- Abdali = their only option
- Exactly what Shivaji feared and never did
- Making alliance with foreigners against fellow Indians

---

## Abdali's Intelligence Network

### The Spy Request

**What Abdali Wrote:**
> "You, the devoted one, should keep to your place, repel and chastise the body of the Marathas, and always send a report of everything correct."

**The System:**
- Get spies to tell him what's going on
- Keep him informed of Maratha movements
- Real-time intelligence

**The Threat:**
> "The boisterous waves of my troops would be immediately turned towards that side."

- If you tell me where Marathas are
- I'll send forces there
- Coordination between forces

### Najib Khan: The Boots on Ground

**His Role:**
- Abdali's biggest weapon
- **Rohilla** commander
- Sitting in and around Delhi
- Doing the work for Abdali
- **Feet on the ground, boots on the ground**
- Can be trusted
- Knows he'll do the job

---

## The Delhi Bloodbath (November 30, 1759)

### Imad-ul-Mulk's Power Play

**The Setup:**
- Returning to **Delhi**

- All royal blood

**The Selection:**

---

## Dattaji's Belated Response

### Abandoning Shukratal

**December 8, 1759:**
- **Lifted his siege**
- After **five months of effort**
- Finally realized fallacy of trying to deal with Najib

**The Strategic Shift:**
- Made deliberate moves
- To safeguard his army
- To protect Delhi
- Moved away from Ganga towards Yamuna

### The Movements

**December 8:**
- Left Shukratal (Ganga)

**December 18:**
- **Crossed Yamuna**
- That's today - December 18
- Made good time - 70-80 miles in 10 days
- Now on **western bank of Yamuna**

### Securing His Forces

**What He Sent Back:**
- Pregnant wife
- Dependents
- Heavy baggage → **Delhi**

**Reserve Force:**
- Some army + **heavy artillery**
- Sent back with **Jankoji and Imaad** (not Imad-ul-Mulk, different person)
- To **Karnal** as reserve

**What He Kept:**
- **25,000 light troops** with himself
- Moved north to face Afghan army
- Near **Thanesar**

---

## Dattaji's Strategic Thinking

### The Underestimation

**Why He Only Kept 25,000:**
- Against Abdali's **60,000**
- Still not enough
- **Taking Abdali lightly**

**The Reason:**
- Malhar Rao Holkar **knew Abdali's might**
- Had dealt with him before
- But Dattaji had **not come one-on-one** with Abdali
- **Not completely aware** of his capability
- May have had **overconfidence**

### The Observation Strategy

**Dattaji's Intention:**
- **Observe the battle** before making plans
- Want to see Abdali in battlefield situation
- Then decide how to fight him
- Strategizing before engagement

**The Problem:**
- Abdali won't give him that chance

---

## Abdali's Counter-Move: The Bypass

### Avoiding Confrontation

**Dattaji's Preparations:**
- Set up at Thanesar
- Ready to face Abdali

**Abdali's Response:**
- Saw Dattaji's preparations
- Moved to **Jagadri**
- To cross Yamuna
- And join Najib
- **Avoiding confrontation** with Dattaji completely

**The Tactic:**
- Bypassed him entirely
- Didn't give Dattaji the battle he wanted
- Sent most luggage via **Budhiya Ghat**
- Stood waiting with artillery

---

## The Battle of Taroari (December 20, 1759)

### The First Engagement

**Maratha Force:**
- Under **Jivaji Bhoite**
- Advanced on **December 20, 1759**
- Encountered some Afghan troops at **Taroari**
- Pushed them back

### The Ambush: Shah Pasand Khan

**What Happened:**
- Marathas and **Imad's small contingent**
- Came upon **5,000 soldiers**
- Under **Shah Pasand Khan** (Abdali's commander)

**Imad's Troops Flee:**
- Seeing Shah Pasand Khan's flag
- **Imad's troops fled the battlefield**
- Abandoned Marathas

### The Technological Massacre

**What Killed Marathas:**
- **Afghan artillery fire**
- **Afghan muskets** took deadly toll
- Against **sword and spear wielding Marathas**

**The Difference in Strategies:**
- Abdali: **Artillery and muskets** (technological advantage)
- Marathas: **Swords and spears** (old-fashioned)
- Cavalry force
- **No answer** for long-range weapons

**The Result:**
- **Several hundred Marathas killed**
- Men then **beheaded**
- Bodies **left lying in the field**

---

## Dattaji's Regret

### Seeing the Carnage

**What He Found:**
- Following the battle
- Saw **decapitated bodies in the field**
- **Immediately regretted** having left his artillery behind

**The Mistake:**
- Following **Bajirao I's strategy**
- Which was to be **light and fast**
- In this case = **big mistake**

**The Problem:**
- This is **not battlefield of Deccan**
- Not what Shivaji specialized in
- This is **flat land**
- **Nowhere to hide** from guns
- Can't hide anywhere
- **Guerrilla warfare has limited scope**

---

## Abdali Crosses Yamuna

### The Night Crossing

**What He Did:**
- Same night (after Taroari)
- Crossed Yamuna at **Budhiya**
- Headed for Shukratal

**The Skill:**
- Afghans had practice crossing rivers
- December = not as difficult (low water)
- But Yamuna is big river
- Still impressive

**The Strategy:**
- Not desiring to fight Dattaji before joining Najib
- Avoided main Maratha force
- Heading to link up with ally
- Then face Marathas with combined force

---

## Dattaji's Call for Help

### The Urgent Message

**What He Did:**
- Sent urgent messages to **Malhar Rao Holkar**
- Asking him to join

**The Plan:**
- Take on Afghans **only after Holkar joined**
- Understood his limitation
- Needs more forces
- Needs cannons
- Needs **long-range cannons**

**The Reality:**
- Finally understanding he's outmatched
- Can't face 60,000 with 25,000
- Can't face artillery with swords
- Needs serious reinforcements

---

## Abdali's Propaganda Victory

### The Letter to Madho Singh

**Abdali's Boast:**
> "An army of 20,000 brave horsemen of Imad and Jankoji were dragged by their hair by death to oppose my victorious troops. A battle ensued. My troops fell upon them like tigers on a flock of sheep."

**The Exaggeration:**
- Actually only a few hundred killed
- Not 20,000
- But making it sound like total victory

**The Message:**
> "Ghazi Uddin [Imad] and Jankoji have fled away like jackals. You should in perfect peace of mind turn to the chastisement of Malhar so that he too may not escape. Rewards are promised to you."

**The Purpose:**
- **Morale boost** to Madho Singh
- Saying: "I've started pushing them back"
- "You can do it too"
- "Fight back against Malhar"
- Trying to keep Holkar tied up in Rajasthan

## Critical Insights

### The Politics > Battle Equation

**Abdali's Mastery:**
- Writes letters to all potential enemies of Marathas
- Rajputs (Madho Singh, Vijay Singh)
- Will do same with Suraj Mal Jat
- Will do same with Shuja Uddaula

**The Goal:**
- Isolate Marathas
- If Hindu powers unite with Marathas = impossible for Abdali
- Must keep them divided
- **Marathas in one camp, everyone else with him**

**Why It Works:**
- Marathas alienated everyone
- Too many tribute demands
- Too intrusive in local affairs
- No allies left
- Easy for Abdali to turn them against Marathas

### The Assassination Strategy

**Imad's Power Consolidation:**
- Killed legitimate emperor
- Killed former vizier who could challenge him
- Installed puppet emperor
- Now has absolute control in Delhi

**Why This Matters:**
- No legitimate authority left
- Just competing claimants
- Shah Jahan III (puppet in Delhi)
- Shah Alam II (legitimate but distant)
- Power vacuum
- Chaos
- Perfect for Abdali

### The Technology Gap

**The Taroari Lesson:**
- Abdali: Artillery + muskets
- Marathas: Swords + spears + cavalry
- **Technological advantage = massacre**

**Dattaji's Realization:**
- Left artillery behind (following Bajirao I's tactics)
- Immediately regretted it
- Flat land = can't hide from guns
- Guerrilla warfare doesn't work here
- **Need long-range cannons**

**The Problem:**
- This isn't Deccan
- Not Shivaji's terrain
- Old tactics don't work
- Need to adapt
- But too late

### The River-Crossing Skill

**Why It Matters:**
- Abdali can cross Yamuna at night
- Despite it being a big river
- Afghans have this skill
- Marathas struggled to cross rivers

**Strategic Implication:**
- Rivers aren't barriers for Abdali
- Can move forces quickly
- Can bypass defenses
- Marathas can't rely on rivers as protection

### The Morale Warfare

**Abdali's Letter Campaign:**
- Exaggerating victories
- "20,000" killed (actually few hundred)
- "Fled like jackals"
- Building his reputation
- Destroying Maratha morale

**The Effect:**
- Madho Singh encouraged to fight Holkar
- Keeps Holkar tied up
- Prevents reinforcements
- All through propaganda

### Dattaji's Underestimation

**The Fatal Flaw:**
- Only kept 25,000 troops
- Against 60,000
- Left artillery behind
- Wanted to "observe" before fighting

**Why:**
- Never faced Abdali personally
- Holkar knew Abdali's might
- But Dattaji didn't
- **Overconfidence**

**The Result:**
- Outmaneuvered
- Outgunned
- Calling for help
- But Holkar still 400km away

---

## What's Coming

**The Setup:**
- Abdali bypassed Dattaji
- Crossing to join Najib at Shukratal
- Combined Afghan-Rohilla force coming
- Dattaji following, but without artillery
- Holkar finally leaving Jaipur (Jan 2, 1760)
- But still 375km away
- Abdali knows timing is perfect

**The Race:**
- Abdali needs to destroy Dattaji **before Holkar arrives**
- Dattaji needs to **survive** until Holkar arrives
- Madho Singh trying to delay Holkar
- Everything depends on timing

---

**November-December 1759: The blood flows in Delhi as Imad murders his way to absolute power. Two emperors now claim the throne - one a puppet, one a distant challenger. Meanwhile, Abdali plays chess with the Rajputs, writing flattering letters while sharpening his knives. At Taroari, Maratha swords meet Afghan muskets, and hundreds of beheaded bodies teach Dattaji the lesson he should have learned months ago: this isn't his grandfather's war. The old tactics are dead. The artillery he left behind could have saved them. Now he's calling desperately for Holkar, 400 kilometers away, while Abdali crosses rivers in the night and consolidates forces. The politics have been won. The battle is just the formality now.**
