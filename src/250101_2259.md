## The Maratha War Rocket

### James Forbes' Description (1770s)

**Who Was James Forbes:**
- British visitor to India in the 1770s
- Wrote extensively about the Maratha army
- Documented their military technology

**The War Rocket Design:**

*Physical Specifications:*
- **Iron tube:** 8-10 inches long, nearly 2 inches in diameter
- **Mounting options:**
  - Iron rod
  - Straight two-edged sword
  - Strong bamboo cane (4-5 feet long) - most common
- **Iron spike** projecting beyond the tube

*How It Worked:*
- Tube filled with combustible materials
- Lighted match sets fire to the fuse
- Projected with great velocity
- If well-directed (uncertain operation) → causes confusion and dismay

**Effectiveness:**
> "Causes much confusion and dismay among the enemy from the difficulty of avoiding its terrifying and destructive effects"

**Historical Note:** A replica exists in a museum in London

## The Magnificent Army: Grant Duff's Account

### The Most Splendid Maratha Force Ever

**Source:** Grant Duff, quoting an eyewitness named **Abhaji Gondeo**

**Who Was Abhaji Gondeo:**
- From Sangam Neer (a city/town)
- Employed at Satara in the 1820s
- Witnessed Sadashiv Rao Bhau's army firsthand

### The Eyewitness Description

**Abhaji Gondeo's Quote:**

> "The equipment of this army was more splendid in appearance than any Maratha force that had ever taken the field."

#### The Camp Equipment

**What Made It Special:**
- Camp equipage brought back from Hindustan by **Raghunath Rao** in earlier expeditions
- This was from a previous expensive campaign
- Now being reused for Bhau's northern march

**The Tents:**
- **Lofty and spacious**
- Lined with **silks and broadcloths**
- Surmounted by **large gilded ornaments**
- Conspicuous at great distance

**The Enclosures:**
- Immense colored walls of canvas
- Enclosed each suite of tents
- For principal officers

#### The Military Display

**What They Had:**
- **Vast numbers of elephants**
- **Flags of all descriptions**
- **The finest horses** - magnificently caparisoned (decorated)
- All accompaniments giving an imposing effect

**The Officers:**
- Dressed in **cloth of gold**
- All competing in profuse and gorgeous display
- "Characteristic of wealth lightly acquired"

**The Style:**
> "An imitation of the more becoming and tasteful array of the magnificent Mughals in the zenith of their glory"

---

## The Criticism & Defense

### Why Europeans Criticized the Display

**The Critique:**
- Many writers called Bhau's splendid army "ostentatious"
- Seen as excessive show-off behavior
- Appeared wasteful

### The Defense: It Was Free!

**The Reality:**
- Material used in the camp was **obtained as war booty**
- Therefore **did not cost the Marathas anything**
- Not a wasteful expense - it was all plunder from previous victories

**The Misconception:**
- European writers believed Marathas spent money on this
- They didn't understand it was all looted from enemies
- Free decorations from conquered territories

---

## Timeline Context

### When Was This Description From?

**The European Visitors:**
- Descriptions written in **1757**
- About the Maratha army at that time

**Continuity to 1760:**
- These characteristics couldn't have changed much in the short time between 1757 and 1760
- When Bhau was heading north to Panipat
- **Ibrahim Khan Gardi** joined Bhau only in **1759**

**Conclusion:** This description was largely representative of the army that went north to Panipat (1760)

---

## The Udgir Victory & Artillery Revolution

### What Happened at Udgir

**The Battle:**
- Fought between Nizam and Bhau-led Maratha army
- Took place at **Udgir** (a town)
- **Marathas won decisively**

### The Game-Changer: Artillery

**Why Udgir Mattered:**
> "The success at Udgir led to the artillery gaining in prominence"

**What Bhau Learned:**
- Artillery prominently showed its effect at Udgir
- Bhau saw the importance of artillery in winning wars
- This would become the **hallmark of the Maratha army**

**The Problem:**
- They only had **ONE YEAR** to incorporate artillery properly
- Not enough time to integrate it fully

---

## The Integration Problem

### Why Artillery Wasn't Fully Integrated

**The Old Army:**
- Rest of the army was not used to fighting with artillery
- Couldn't fight "in a disciplined manner" with it
- Old-fashioned Maratha army up until that point

**What Was Missing:**
- No **teamwork** between artillery and infantry
- No proper **integration** of artillery into tactics
- Army didn't understand what artillery was supposed to do
- Artillery was just "added" - not properly incorporated

**The Result:**
- The Maratha army was still adjusting to the new method of warfare
- This would be perfected later by **Mahadji Shinde**

---

## The Future: Mahadji Shinde's Perfection

### The Shinde Clan Leadership Succession

**The Lineage:**
1. **Jayappa Shinde** (elder brother, died early)
2. **Dattaji Shinde** (took over after Jayappa)
3. **Jankoji Shinde** (son of Jayappa, about 20-22 years old)
4. **Mahadji Shinde** (after Panipat battle)

### Mahadji's Role at Panipat

**He Was There:**
- Present at the Third Battle of Panipat (1760)
- Got **severely wounded**
- Somehow made it back alive
- His **leg was permanently damaged**

**But It Didn't Matter:**
- Leg injury didn't stop him
- Went on to become the greatest Shinde commander
- Perfected the artillery-infantry integration that Bhau started

---

## The Shinde Clan's Mission

### Permanent Northern Presence

**The Strategic Role:**
- Shinde family force always in northern plains of India
- On behalf of the Peshwas
- Stationed in the north along with Holkar army

**Why This Mattered:**
- Constant Maratha presence in the north
- Ready to respond to threats
- Could protect Maratha interests
- Collect taxes and maintain order

---

## Govindapant Bundele: The Forgotten Tax Collector

### The Original Northern Administrator

**Who Was Govindapant Bundele:**
- Appointed by **Bajirao I** (the first)
- Originally Maharashtrian (not actually named "Bundele")
- Got the name "Bundele" because always based in **Bundelkhand**

**His Routine:**
- Came to Pune **only once a year**
- Would do one-on-one with Peshwa
- Give annual account in person
- Then return to the north

### His Operation

**The Setup:**
- Had a small army of **1,000-2,000 people**
- Collected taxes in Bundelkhand
- If taxes didn't come easily → he'd use force

**His Role:**
- Tax collector/enforcer
- Small skirmishes or enforcement actions
- Based permanently in northern plains

**By 1760:**
- Elderly gentleman, about **55 years old**
- Still doing his job

---

## Bundelkhand: The Strategic Location

### Where It Is

**Geographic Position:**
- **South of Delhi** by about 100 miles
- Deep into the northern plains
- Very strategic location

### The Unfulfilled Promise

**Govindapant's Request:**
- Kept asking Nana Saheb Peshwa for a bigger force
- Wanted **20,000 troops permanently based there**
- Argued it was a strategic area needing protection
- Could send troops to Delhi or anywhere in north as needed

**Peshwa's Response:**
- Kept promising "Okay, okay, I will look into it"
- But never delivered
- **Why?** It cost a lot of money - salaries for 20,000 people
- Required great justification to incur that cost
- Kept postponing the promise

**The Realization:**
- When the time came (1760), Peshwa understood the importance
- **But by then it was too late**

### Govindapant's Character

- **Fairly honest personality**
- Reliable administrator
- But under-resourced for the task

---

## Sadashiv Rao Bhau: The Finance Warrior

### The Rare Two-in-One Leader

**What Made Bhau Special:**
- As much a **warrior** as a **finance man**
- Good accountant himself
- Could manage finance as well as battle

**His Financial Skills:**
- In his spare time in Pune: in charge of **finance department**
- Well-versed in accounting
- Kept very good tabs on where money was coming from and going
- Would account for **every penny**
- Nobody could fool him

**The Discipline:**
- Highly disciplined personality
- Understood accounts payable, accounts receivable
- Very good with math and basic accounting

### Comparison to Raghunath Rao

**Raghunath Rao:**
- Pure warrior
- Didn't handle finance or administration
- Would depend on his staff

**Sadashiv Rao Bhau:**
- Expert financier himself
- Plus warrior
- **Two-in-one** - very rare and valuable

---

## Bhau's Personal Regimen

### The Physical Discipline

**Morning Routine:**
- After taking bath
- All kinds of exercises for **1.5 to 2 hours**
- Very well-built body
- Impressive physique

### The Weakness

**His Temper:**
- **Very hot temper**
- Could be fiery
- This was his only weak point

---

## The Revenue Crisis

### The Tax Collection Problem

**The Original Plan:**
- Elderly Govindapant Bundele would collect taxes
- Remit **half of revenues to Pune**
- Hand over **only half to Bhau**

**What Actually Happened:**
> "This did not quite happen as planned"

**Why It Failed:**
- War-ravaged conditions in the north
- Unsettled situation
- **The pie had shrunk**

### The Math Problem

**Before:**
- Could collect $1,000 per month
- Half to Pune, half to Bhau = $500 each

**Now:**
- Could only collect $500 total
- Half to Pune, half to Bhau = $250 each
- **Huge drop in revenue**

**The Crisis:**
- Everyone gets much less
- But still have to maintain huge army
- Salaries must be paid
- Weapons must be bought
- Animals must be fed

**Result:** Bhau was under tremendous financial stress

---

## The Supply Problem

### Ahmadnagar Armory

**The Solution:**
- The forts at **Ahmadnagar** had armory
- Used to supply necessary ammunition
- For muskets, cannons, rockets, etc.
- At least they had weapons

---

## The Udgir Aftermath: No Rest for the Weary

### The Immediate Problem

**After Udgir Battle:**
- Soldiers who fought Nizam needed rest
- Should ideally have time to **recuperate**
- Needed to restock supplies
- Take inventory of losses
- Compensate losses in arms or horses (steed)

**What Actually Happened:**
> "The soldiers had no respite after the Udgir campaign and little time to compensate the losses in arms or steed, and had to leave for the north immediately"

### Why the Urgency?

**The Wake-Up Call:**
- Nana Saheb Peshwa and military leaders in Pune were **almost sleeping**
- Completely unaware of the situation in the north
- Underestimated the threat from Abdali
- Thought **Taji Shinde** could handle it

**The Reality Check:**
- The threat was **beyond Taji**
- Much bigger than he could handle alone
- The ferocity and size of Abdali's force was massive

---

## The News That Changed Everything

### Taji Shinde's Death

**When They Heard:**
- News came of Taji's death
- **They immediately woke up**
- Realized this was much bigger than imagined

**The Realization:**
> "This cannot be continued like this. If Taji cannot handle it, then we have to send a big army and we have to send it right now."

### Why Abdali Was Different

**The Track Record:**
- They knew from previous experience how barbaric Abdali was
- What he did in **Mathura**:
  - Killed hundreds and thousands of innocent people
  - Just to collect money and loot
  - To "teach a lesson to these kafirs"

**His Only Goals:**
1. Collect money/loot
2. Teach kafirs a lesson
3. That's it

**The Fear:**
- "We can't handle this again"
- This level of barbarity was unprecedented
- Required immediate response

---

## The Strategic Miscalculation

### Nana Saheb's Error

**What He Thought:**
- Taji Shinde is enough to handle northern threats
- No need for massive intervention
- Can manage with existing forces

**The Reality:**
- Never knew what kind of ferocious and huge threat it was
- Didn't understand the scale of Abdali's invasion
- **"Almost sleeping at the wheel"**

**The Correction:**
- Taji's death really woke him up
- Understood it would take a **huge army**
- Cannot be done by Holkar or Shinde alone
- Not enough forces

---

## The Forced March: No Time to Prepare

### The Immediate Order

**What Should Have Happened:**
- Rest after Udgir battle
- Refurbish weaponry and arms
- Restock supplies
- Replace horses
- Let soldiers recover

**What Actually Happened:**
- **No respite**
- **No refurbishing of weapons**
- **No rest**
- Whatever they had, they just took it
- March immediately

**The Urgency:**
> "Now the army goes right now. There is no respite. No nothing. No refurbishing of arms or nothing. Nobody gets any rest. You just immediately get going."

### Why So Rushed?

**The Timing:**
- Abdali was **already there** in the north
- Every day of delay = more destruction
- More innocent people killed
- More territory lost

**The Surprise Factor:**
- Taken completely by surprise
- Didn't see it coming
- Untimely death of Taji they never expected
- Had to react instantly

## Geographic Context

**Bundelkhand:**
- South of Delhi by ~100 miles
- Deep in northern plains
- Strategic location
- Where Govindapant Bundele operated

**Ahmadnagar:**
- Had major armory
- Supplied ammunition for the northern campaign

**Udgir:**
- Town where battle against Nizam took place
- Where artillery proved decisive

**The Northern Plains:**
- Where Abdali was operating

---

## Major Themes

### 1. Artillery Revolution
Udgir victory showed artillery's importance, but only one year to integrate it properly before Panipat.

### 2. The Splendor Paradox
Most magnificent Maratha army ever assembled, but it was all free (war booty) - not wasteful spending.

### 3. Strategic Miscalculation
Peshwa "sleeping at the wheel" - underestimated Abdali threat until too late.

### 4. No Time to Prepare
Army forced to march immediately after exhausting Udgir campaign - no rest, no resupply, no preparation.

### 5. Financial Genius Warrior
Bhau was rare combination of financial expert and military commander - could handle both money and battles.

### 6. The Warning Signs Ignored
Govindapant Bundele requested 20,000 troops for years - Peshwa kept promising but never delivered. When crisis came, it was too late.

### 7. The Wake-Up Call
Taji Shinde's death was the moment Pune leadership realized the true scale of the threat.

---

## Key Contrasts

### Old vs. New Warfare
- **Old:** Traditional Maratha cavalry tactics
- **New:** Artillery-based warfare (just starting to learn)
- **Problem:** Only one year to integrate

### Raghunath Rao vs. Sadashiv Rao Bhau
- **Raghunath Rao:** Pure warrior, depends on staff for admin
- **Bhau:** Warrior + finance expert = two-in-one leader

### What Should Have Happened vs. What Did
- **Should:** Rest after Udgir, restock, prepare
- **Did:** Immediate forced march north with whatever they had

### Perception vs. Reality (European Critiques)
- **Perception:** Ostentatious waste of money
- **Reality:** All war booty - didn't cost anything

---

## The Irony

**The Greatest Army:**
- Most splendid Maratha force ever assembled
- Best equipment, finest horses, magnificent display
- But rushed into battle without proper rest or integration
- Forced march immediately after exhausting campaign

**The Financial Expert:**
- Bhau was the perfect person to manage this campaign
- Finance genius who could track every penny
- But faced severe revenue shortfalls
- War-ravaged north couldn't provide expected funds

**The Warning:**
- Govindapant Bundele warned for years about needing more troops
- Peshwa kept promising but never delivered
- When crisis came, Peshwa finally understood
- But by then it was too late

---

## What's Coming

**The Immediate Challenge:**
- Exhausted army marching north
- No rest or resupply
- Facing barbaric Abdali
- Insufficient funds
- Artillery not fully integrated
- Against the clock

**The Stakes:**
- Abdali already in northern plains
- Massacring innocents
- Looting territory
- Must be stopped immediately
- No time for proper preparation

---

*The most magnificent Maratha army ever assembled was being rushed into the most critical battle in Maratha history - exhausted, under-supplied, with revolutionary artillery tactics not yet fully integrated. Bhau, the rare finance-warrior genius, would have to make it work somehow. But they were out of time, out of money, and Abdali was already there.*
