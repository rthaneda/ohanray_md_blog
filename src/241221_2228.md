- **January 10** death → **February 13** news arrives

**Nanasaheb's Reaction:**
- **Completely collapses**
- Meaning **psychologically**

- Letters coming
- But now he was in **deep slumber**
- **Suddenly awakens**

### The New Understanding

**The Crucial Moment:**
> "This is what causes the third battle of Panipat."

---

## Understanding the Responsibility

### Why It Falls to Marathas

**The Treaty Obligation:**
- Remember the truce with **Mughal emperor**
- Were **sworn to protect the Mughals**
- Even by that contract/treaty
- They were **responsible**

**The Practical Reality:**
- **Nobody else** could do it
- No other army in North India
- Entire responsibility fell upon Marathas

**The National View:**
- Looked at it as **invasion from foreign power**
- Abdali not part of **Indian landmass**
- Came from **Afghanistan**
- Considered **separate country**
- Different culture

### The Pattern

**The History:**
- Abdali **ransacking areas at will**
- Done it **three or four times before**
- Nobody to **revert his charges**
- Huge deal

**The Decision:**
- Nanasaheb knew **something big** had to be done
- Or **this will come back** again and again
- Calls all commanders
- In the Deccan and everywhere
- Come and meet in **Pathdur**

---

## Dattaji's Fatal Error

### The Underestimation

**What He Thought:**
- Abdali was **weak**
- He's **namard** (coward/unmanly)
- Because would **lead army from rear guard**
- Will **not be in front**

**The Charge:**
- So Dattaji just **charged in there with his spear**
- Thought could take him
- **Too much for him**
- Wasn't planning properly

### The Better General

**The Reality:**
> "Abdali was strategic and tactical about his moves. So this was all about who was a better general."

**Dattaji's Mistakes:**
- Didn't bring the **guns needed**
- Sent away his **artillery**
- Wanted to **move quickly** from place to place
- Following **Bajirao I's tactics**

**Why It Failed:**
- Thought Abdali weak and namard
- But Abdali led from rear = **smart tactics**
- Not cowardice = **strategy**
- Like how Dattaji **died because of this**

---

## The War Council at Pathdur

### The Question

**The Issue:**
> "Who will lead this campaign against Abdali? Because the campaign has to be done. And who is going to lead it? Because that's the million dollar question."

**Who's Up to the Challenge?**

---

## Considering Raghunath Rao

### The Pros & Cons

**Against Sending Him:**
- When he went north **twice**
- Came back with **even bigger loans**
- **Financial risk**
- Didn't want that

**In Favor of Him:**
- **Knew the politics of the North**
- Had gone there twice
- Knew **all the players** in North
- How they acted
- How they behaved
- What was their **weak point**
- What was **strong point**
- What is the **geography**
- They also were **aware of Raghunath Rao**

**The Assessment:**
- Could have done **better job**
- But financial risk too high

---

## The Choice: Sadashiv Rao Bhau

### Why Bhau Was Chosen

**The Impression:**
- Nanasaheb **so impressed** by Sadashiv Rao Bhau
- That he **won this battle with Nizam**
- Just proved himself

**The Artillery Factor:**
- Also impressed by **role played by artillery**
- Sadashiv Rao **understood role of artillery**
- Said: "Without long range artillery"
- "That he had at disposal during that battle"
- "**We could not have won this war**"
- "That is the **only way going forward**"
- "We are going to fight the battles"

**The Commander:**
- Knew **exactly the man** he could employ
- Ibrahim Khan Gardi
- So responsibility fell upon **Sadashiv Rao**

---

## Bhau's Character: The Problems

### Problem 1: Hot Tempered

**The First Issue:**
> "He was extremely hot tempered."

**What This Means:**
- Once he got **upset and angry**
- **No way** for him to think rationally
- Would just be **taken over by anger**
- And upset
- That was **big, big point**

**The Consequence:**
- Didn't see anything
- Didn't think **calmly and quietly**
- The way **rationally** decisions have to be made

---

### Problem 2: Northern Politics

**The Second Issue:**
> "He did not understand the politics of the North."

**Why:**
- Never dealt with **Rajputs**
- Didn't deal with **Jats**
- Never dealt with **Mughals or Rohillas**
- **Abdali**: Of course never fought him
- Never seen him in battlefield

---

## Bhau's Strengths

### The Positive Side

**What He Had:**
- Very **skilled fighter and commander**
- Would **not play games**
- Simply come to point
- Say: "Hey, **deliver results right now**"

**The Problem:**
> "He was not a good politician."

**The Balance:**
- Negative: **Hot-tempered, no political skills**
- Positive: **Brave commander, direct, skilled fighter**

## Critical Insights

### The Awakening Metaphor

**The Language:**
- "Deep slumber"
- "Suddenly awakens"
- "Aroused from his slumber"

**What It Means:**
- Nanasaheb was **sleepwalking**
- Complacent about northern threat
- Thought commanders could handle it
- **Reality** finally hits

**The Moment:**
- This is **THE turning point**
- "The story really begins here"
- "This causes third battle of Panipat"
- Everything before = prologue
- Everything after = consequences

### The One-Month Information Gap

**The Math:**
- January 10: Dattaji dies
- February 13: News arrives
- **~34 days** for message

**The Problem:**
- **Can't respond** in real-time
- **Can't prevent** disaster
- Can only **react**
- Always behind

**The Implication:**
- By time Pune responds
- Situation will have **changed again**
- Always playing catch-up
- **Fog of war** literal

### The Underestimation Theme

**The Pattern:**
- **Dattaji** underestimated Abdali
- **Nanasaheb** underestimated situation
- "Pesky Afghans not a big deal"
- Learning through **catastrophic failure**

**Why They Underestimated:**
- Never faced him directly
- Listened to reports/letters
- Thought they understood
- But **reports ≠ reality**
- Like being told about fire
- vs. **being burned**

### Raghunath Rao: The Road Not Taken

**What We Learn:**
- He **knew northern politics**
- Knew all the players
- Knew geography
- Had relationships
- **Political skill**

**Why Not Chosen:**
- **Financial liability**
- Came back with loans twice
- Can't afford that again

**The Irony:**
- Choose **military skill** over **political skill**
- But this war will be decided by **politics**
- The better general militarily may not win
- Because politics > battle

### Bhau's Fatal Flaw #1: Hot Temper

**Why This Matters:**
- Northern politics requires **patience**
- Requires **negotiations**
- Requires **swallowing pride**
- Requires **tactical retreat**

**Bhau's Nature:**
- Gets angry
- **Can't think rationally**
- Taken over by emotion
- **No calm decision-making**

**The Consequence:**
- In crucial moments
- When diplomacy needed
- He'll **lose his temper**
- Make **emotional decisions**
- **Alienate allies**

### Bhau's Fatal Flaw #2: No Northern Experience

**What He Doesn't Know:**
- Rajput politics
- Jat politics  
- Mughal court intrigue
- Rohilla motivations
- **Abdali's tactics**

**Why This Matters:**
- Will have to **learn on the job**
- During **existential crisis**
- With **no margin for error**
- While Abdali **knows all this**

**The Comparison:**
- Abdali: **Expert** in northern politics
- Spent years cultivating allies
- Knows every player
- Bhau: **Complete novice**

### The Artillery Understanding Gap

**What Bhau Knows:**
- Artillery = key to victory
- **Only way forward**
- Must use it properly
- Proved it against Nizam

**What He'll Face:**
- Cavalry that **doesn't believe** in artillery
- Chiefs not convinced
- Cultural resistance
- **Indiscipline**

**The Problem:**
- **Bhau understands**
- **Army doesn't**
- Gap in understanding
- Will be **fatal**

### The Direct Commander Style

**Bhau's Approach:**
- "Deliver results **right now**"
- No games
- Come to point
- **Direct**

**Why This Could Work:**
- Clear command
- No ambiguity
- Decisive

**Why This Will Fail:**
- Northern politics = **indirect**
- Need to **play games**
- Need **patience**
- Need **subtlety**
- Bhau has **none of this**

### The Comprehensive Response

**The Shift:**
- Before: "Send a commander or two"
- Now: "**Comprehensive manner**"
- Recognize it's **much bigger**
- Can't be **half-measures**

**What This Means:**
- **Massive army** going north
- **Full commitment**
- **All-in** strategy
- If this fails = **catastrophic**

### The "Really Begins" Moment

**The Significance:**
> "So here, the story really begins."

**What This Tells Us:**
- Everything before = **setup**
- All the invasions
- All the politics
- All the battles
- Were just **prelude**

**The Reality:**
- Panipat is coming
- **Inevitable** now
- Dattaji's death = catalyst
- Bhau's appointment = trigger
- **No turning back**

---

## What's Coming

**The Setup:**
- Bhau chosen to lead
- Hot-tempered
- Doesn't know northern politics
- Understands artillery
- But army doesn't
- Direct style in indirect world

**The Army:**
- Will be massive
- Comprehensive response
- Ibrahim Khan Gardi
- Best artillery in India
- But indisciplined cavalry

**The Opposition:**
- Abdali in Delhi
- Knows northern politics perfectly
- Strategic genius
- Has momentum
- Has allies

**The Question:**
- Can Bhau adapt?
- Will hot temper doom him?
- Can he learn politics fast enough?
- Will artillery advantage matter?
- If cavalry indisciplined?

---

**February 13, 1760: The celebration ends. The messenger arrives. Dattaji is dead. "Bachenge to aur bhi ladenge" - if I survive, I will fight even more - those were his last words before Qutub Shah beheaded him. Twenty thousand men fled without fighting. Nanasaheb collapses psychologically. He was in deep slumber. This news awakens him. Drastically. He finally understands what he's up against. Not pesky Afghans. An existential threat. This cannot be handled by sending a commander or two. This requires a comprehensive response. He considers Raghunath Rao - knows the politics, but financial liability. He chooses Sadashiv Rao Bhau - proved himself against Nizam, understands artillery, brave commander. But: hot-tempered, doesn't know northern politics, not a good politician. The wrong choice? The right choice? We'll find out. Because here, the story really begins. Everything before was prologue. What comes next will determine the fate of India.**
