## The Artillery Revelation

### Ibrahim Khan's Impact

**What Happened:**
> "The artillery of Ibrahim Khan made its mark and impressed Bhau by its efficacy."

**This Is Important:**
- Bhau understood **importance of artillery force**
- In winning battle on **flat land**

**Before:**
- Not necessarily discounted artillery
- But now saw **demonstration in actual practice**

**The Realization:**
- **Undeniable** now
- This was **the future**
- Said: "This is something that is **extreme**"
- Very impressed

**The Analysis:**
- Now artillery fire from Ibrahim Khan
- Without it, battle **very difficult to win**
- Just based on cavalry and foot soldiers = not enough
- Said: "This is something that is going to **make the difference**"

---

## The Divided Opinion

### Bhau vs. Other Chiefs

**Bhau's View:**
- **Very much impressed**
- Only one **ahead of his time**
- Said: "If we want to win wars of future"
- "Artillery guns with long range power = **must**"
- "Without which **we cannot do**"
- **Convinced**
- Said: "This is it, going forward this is my **main stake**"
- Thinking of **future battles**
- **Sticking with artillery**

**Other Maratha Chiefs:**
- **Not with him**
- Did not see it that way
- Did not understand **power of artillery**
- Why it's necessary

**The Problem:**
- Not necessarily **resentment**
- But **not really completely convinced**
- Maybe just **lack of discipline**
- Wouldn't believe they could trust artillery

**The Context:**
- This happening for **first time**
- Sadashiv really impressed

---

## The Zenith of Maratha Power

### The New Reality

**Mughals in Deccan:**
- Very **little territory** now
- Only because of Nizam
- Now **almost totally gone**

**The Foothold:**
- Nizam was **city of Mughal**
- Their **foothold in Deccan**
- Now Marathas **calling the shots**
- Were **the boss**
- **In their homeland**

### The National Pride

**Nana Saheb Peshwa:**
- At **zenith of his reign**
- Kingdom at its **most powerful**

**Grant Duff's Assessment:**
- **Southernmost rivers** in Indian peninsula (Bhima)
- **Deccan horse** quenched thirst from **waters of Indus** (north)
- **Maratha people felt pride** in conquests of countrymen

**The Context:**
- Abdali was **foreigner**
- Would come and go
- Not part of **Indian landscape**
- Basically **no parallel** to Maratha power
- In **entire Indian subcontinent**
- **Outsider** but big threat

**The Reality:**
- Entire **Indian landmass**
- No other parallel for Marathas
- Now the **preeminent power**

## Critical Insights

### The Assassination as Nizam's Desperation

**Why It Matters:**
- Nizam **so threatened** by Bhau
- Willing to **assassinate** through proxy
- Shows how dangerous Bhau was
- But also shows Nizam's **weakness**

**The Betrayal:**
- Muzaffar Khan takes the fall
- Nizam throws him under bus
- Even though **Nizam ordered it**
- Classic political murder

### The Hollow Square Tactic

**European Warfare:**
- Nizam using **European tactics**
- Learned from colonial powers
- Square formation with artillery
- Very effective defensive formation

**Why It Worked (Temporarily):**
- Protected retreat
- Artillery covering all sides
- Moving fortress essentially
- Prevented Maratha cavalry charges

**Why It Failed:**
- Marathas had **better artillery** (Ibrahim Khan)
- Could break the formation
- Bhau attacked **weak part**
- Cut off supplies
- 40 miles from safety = too far

### The Artillery Awakening

**Bhau's Revelation:**
- First commander to **fully understand**
- Artillery = future of warfare
- **Ahead of his time**
- Saw it in actual practice
- Completely convinced

**The Problem:**
- **Other chiefs not convinced**
- This will cause issues later
- Cultural resistance to new warfare
- Glory-seeking vs. tactical advantage
- **Indiscipline** will be fatal

**The Irony:**
- Bhau learned lesson perfectly
- But army **won't follow** his vision
- He'll have the artillery
- But **won't be able to use it** properly
- Because of cavalry indiscipline

### The Two-Front War

**November 1759 Reality:**
- **North:** Abdali threatening Dattaji
- **South:** Nizam campaign
- Army **stretched breath in on two ends**

**The Danger:**
- Can't focus full strength anywhere
- Resources divided
- If one front collapses, other threatened
- This is **unsustainable**

### The Zenith Before the Fall

**The Peak:**
- Nana Saheb at **zenith of power**
- Kingdom most powerful
- No parallel in India
- Just defeated Nizam
- Took half his kingdom
- National pride

**The Timing:**
> "At the zenith of his power, Nana Saheb Peshwa was faced with a crisis of massive proportions."

**The Pattern:**
- Classic **hubris before nemesis**
- Highest point = moment before fall
- Celebrating victory
- While disaster brewing in north
- 8 days of celebration
- Then the bad news

### The February 13 News

**What Must Have Happened:**
- **Dattaji's death** (January 10)
- News takes **~1 month** to reach Pune
- Arrives February 13
- During celebration
- **Ends celebration immediately**

**The Impact:**
- Nanasaheb **shocked beyond belief**
- Realized **underestimating** situation
- Everything changes
- Must respond comprehensively
- No more half-measures

### The Geographic Nightmare

**The Problem:**
- **1,000 miles** between Pune and Dattaji's position
- 2 weeks for **any message**
- Can't coordinate
- Can't respond quickly
- **Fog of war** literal

**The Result:**
- By time they know = **too late**
- Dattaji already dead
- Army already routed
- Can only **react**, not prevent

### Bhau's Character Revealed

**The Recovery:**
- Stabbed in back
- Still recovering in December
- Can't do push-ups
- Wound causing aches

**The Determination:**
- Still leads campaign
- Still fights
- Still wins
- **Toughness**

**The Intelligence:**
- Only one who **understood artillery**
- Ahead of his time
- Strategic thinker
- But also **hot-tempered** (foreshadowed earlier)

---

## What's Coming

**The Setup:**
- Bhau impressed by artillery
- Other chiefs not convinced
- Nanasaheb shocked by northern disaster
- Calls meeting at Pathdur
- Must decide response to Abdali
- Someone must go north
- Comprehensively, not half-measures

**The Question:**
- Who will lead the campaign?
- Raghunath Rao? (experienced but financially risky)
- Sadashiv Rao Bhau? (just proved himself, understands artillery)
- Someone else?

**The Foreshadowing:**
- Bhau understands artillery importance
- But other chiefs don't
- This **gap in understanding** will matter
- Cavalry indiscipline will persist
- Bhau hot-tempered (problem in politics)
- Doesn't know northern politics

---

**October 1759 - February 1760: Bhau survives a knife in the back. Muzaffar Khan doesn't. The Nizam tries the European hollow square formation, but Ibrahim Khan's French cannons tear it apart. Bhau watches and learns: artillery is the future. The other chiefs watch and don't learn. Half the Nizam's kingdom falls. The Marathas celebrate for eight days. On day nine, a messenger arrives from the north. Dattaji is dead. The celebration ends. Nanasaheb, at the absolute zenith of his power, realizes he's been underestimating everything. He calls everyone to Pathdur. Someone has to go north. Someone has to face Abdali. Comprehensively. No more half-measures. The question is: who? And the answer will determine everything that follows.**
