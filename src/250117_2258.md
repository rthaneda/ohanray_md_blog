# Bhau's March North: The River Crossing Crisis (March-April 1760)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The New Chapter: From Udgir to Delhi

### The Starting Point

**Where:**
- Started from **Patador** (close to Aurangabad)
- Also referenced: **Udgir** (where battle with Nizam happened)

**Why Patador:**
- Closer to Aurangabad
- Nana Sahib Peshwa invited everybody there
- Major commanders got together
- Make decisions about campaign shape
- Who should lead
- All that stuff

**The Journey:**
- Essentially started from Udgir
- How his travel towards Delhi was
- That's what they're going to describe

---

## Bhau's Quote (June 10, 1760)

### From Govind Pant's Letter

**What Bhau Said:**
- 50 miles away from **Agra**
- Now will cross the **Gambhir river**
- "Now you will see the problems"

**About Gambhir:**
- Not a major river
- Just a **tributary** that merges into Narmada
- But remember: this is **monsoon**

---

## The River Crossing Disaster: One Month for Small River

### The Shocking Reality

**The Timeline:**
> "Gambhir river to cross it, it took him a month."

**The Scale:**
- With his force
- Everyone
- Entourage
- **One month**
- For a **not major river**

### The Implication

**What It Showed:**
> "Imagine how inept they were, Maratha army, to cross rivers."

**The Contrast with Abdali:**
- Abdali had crossed **how many rivers**?
- To come into Delhi
- Past Delhi
- Already in the **Doab** (between Ganga and Yamuna)
- Already crossed **Yamuna**
- Got into Doab

**Abdali's River Crossings:**
- Had to cross **Sindhu**
- Had to cross **Jhelum**
- Bunch of **five rivers** actually
- Did it during winter months probably
- But somehow had the **technique**

**The Difference:**
> "That was one reason."
- Abdali: mastered river crossing
- Marathas: completely inept at it

---

## The Campaign Planning at Patador

### The Strategy Session

**What Happened:**
- Deliberations with major commanders
- How campaign should take shape
- Who will do what
- What are strategies
- What alliances to form
- With which powers
- All that stuff

**Then:**
- He left Patador
- Beginning point
- Left from his own domain (the Khan/Deccan)

---

## The Nizam Problem: Unfulfilled Treaty

### After Winning at Udgir

**The Situation:**
- Bhau won war with **Nizam** at Udgir
- Came to Patadur because Nana Sahib wanted to consult
- Immediately after: didn't get any **respite**
- Had to get to north
- It was **urgent**

### Nizam's Betrayal

**What Happened:**
- Whatever truce treaty Nizam agreed to
- Because he **lost** that battle
- He just did **not fulfill** all the treaties
- All the articles he agreed to

**Bhau's Frustration:**
- Had **no time to waste** to enforce treaties
- Felt **bad**
- Couldn't fully enforce treaty articles
- No time to waste
- **Priority**: huge calamity on northern frontier
- Had to leave quickly

**Nizam Saw the Opportunity:**
> "Now Nizam saw the opportunity because these guys are now going to be gone. They have no option. He said, why should I fulfill my remaining things?"

**The Reversion:**
- Going to go back to old ways
- Going to be disloyal again
- "You guys are in a hurry"
- "You have a big thing to enforce"
- "I'm not gonna live up to my remaining [obligations]"
- New deal sucks for him
- "Screw you, what are you gonna do?"

**Bhau's Feeling:**
- Chosen commanders going north
- Weapons going north
- Nanasaheb Peshwa doesn't have time to enforce
- Very **dejected**
- On one hand: can't do anything
- Thought: "This is not right"
- "This has to be done"
- "But I can't do anything about it"
- Upset, frustrated, angry, disappointed

---

## Raghunath Rao Stays Back

### Why He Didn't Go North

**The Reason:**
- To keep eye on **Nizam and Karnataka**
- Raghunath Rao didn't get to lead campaign
- He asked for **preposterous resources**
- Nanasaheb said: "You are no good"
- "You only increase my loan"
- "You're not going anywhere"

**Raghunath Rao's Response:**
- "If I'm not going, I'm not going to north at all"
- "If I go, I will go as the **leader of the army**"
- Or **not at all**
- Won't be **second fiddle** to Sadashiv Bhau

**The Result:**
- He just didn't go
- Nanasaheb said: "Okay, fine, stay back"
- "But we have this challenge with Nizam"
- "What he's doing in Karnataka"
- "You need to stay anyway"
- "Marathas need to have some punch"
- Need you
- Can't completely forget about Nizam
- He was capable of making lot of bad stuff

---

## Vishwas Rao: The 19-Year-Old Commander

### Who He Was

**The Background:**
- **Nanasaheb Peshwa's son**
- **Eldest son**
- Hardly **19 years old**

**His Training:**
- Experienced battle under **Sadashiv Rao Bhau**
- In **Karnataka**
- Under his **tutelage**
- How to lead battle
- What kind of moves to make

**His Destiny:**
- Being groomed as Nanasaheb Peshwa's **replacement**
- Once Nanasaheb out of picture
- Being trained under Sadashiv Rao Bhau

### His Role in the Campaign

**The Title:**
- Nanasaheb made him **namesake commander in chief**
- Overall head of the campaign
- But everybody understood:
- **Sadashiv Rao Bhau** was the acting and real chief
- That was for sure

**The Purpose:**
- Nanasaheb wanted to give message
- Vishwas Rao is the **sovereign** for all practical purposes
- Because: no system where every decision comes to Nanasaheb
- From wherever the army is in north
- No time for that

**The Reality:**
- Decision making power rested with Vishwas Rao
- But Vishwas Rao obviously would defer to Sadashiv Rao Bhau
- Didn't have enough experience
- Idea: he will get experience
- Be ready when time comes to take over Nanasaheb's job

---

## The Most Handsome Man in India

### Vishwas Rao's Appearance

**The Reputation:**
> "In those days, Vishwas Rao was supposed to be the most handsome man in entire India."

### After His Death

**What Happened:**
- Vishwas Rao was **killed**
- Body fell into hands of Afghans
- They said: he was so **handsome**
- So **young** (barely 19 years old)
- No damage on body except bullet pierced his **head**

**The Afghan Plan:**
> "We need to freeze his body with stuff like that and preserve him in Kabul. Kind of embalming like the Egyptians would do. We want to put him on display or something like that."

**That's How Handsome:**
- They wanted to **preserve** him
- Display him in **Kabul**
- Like a trophy

### Kashi Raj Pandit's Intervention

**Who Intervened:**
- After battle was over
- Both bodies (Vishwas Rao and presumably Bhau) fell into Abdali's hands
- **Suja-ud-Daula** sent his administrator
- That **Kashi Raj Pandit** guy (Hindu administrative personality)

**What He Said to Abdali:**
- "You are **king of kings**"
- "It doesn't look good on you"
- "To play with bodies of your so-called enemies"
- "But they are **no more enemies** of yours"
- "They're **dead**"
- "You should let it go"
- "Give these bodies to Kashi Raj Pandit"
- "Let them be given **proper honor**"
- "Whatever rituals Hinduism demands or wants"
- "Proper burial" (not burial, but proper things)
- "You should have the **generous heart**"

**What Happened:**
- Didn't preserve Vishwas Rao
- Probably didn't have time
- Or listened to Kashi Raj Pandit

---

## The Jat Community

### Who They Are

**The Background:**
- Jats are **old community** in India

**Jat Sikhs:**
- When some Jats converted to **Sikhism**
- They are called **Jat Sikhs**
- Still remember forefathers used to be Jat
- Take **pride** in that

**Their Reputation:**
- Very, very good **fighters**
- In Indian army: very well known
- **Even to this day**
- Really the **battle-hardening** part of the army

---

## Bhau's Letter to Northern Powers

### The Appeal

**The Argument:**
> "We should not allow Abdali to take roots in India."

**About the Mughals:**
- **Chakateyachi or Chugtai Gharane** (original Mughal name)
- Referring to **Timur lineage**
- "By then Mughals were almost **Indian**"
- Even though ancestors came from **outside of India**
- From **central India** (Central Asia)
- But at least were considered kind of **to belong**

**The Message:**
> "Now we have to get together and protect the Mughal empire. Because they are no Indian, we don't consider them as outsiders. They are one of us, so we have to protect them and keep them in place."

### The Promise

**What Bhau Pledged:**
- None of you should make alliance with Abdali
- If we gain **victory**
- We will give the rule in hands of **Mughal emperor**
- We'll **resurrect Mughal emperor**
- Raise him again

**The Subtext:**
> "Don't worry, I'm not going to take the throne."

---

## Why Resurrecting the Mughals Mattered

### The Comfort Factor

**The Reality:**
- In India: all these kingdoms, everybody
- Were **comfortable** with Mughal emperor
- Been there for **300 years**
- "The devil you know"

**The Alternative Problem:**
- Moment you get rid of Mughal emperor
- Who else?
- **Suraj Mal** says: "I want to be that man"
- **Jaudwila** (Suja?) says: "I want to be new power in Delhi"
- "It's going to be a **mess**"
- Marathas will say: "We want to be the power"
- Then **infighting** will begin

### The Strategy

**What Marathas Wanted:**
- Some **namesake emperor**
- Nobody will oppose Mughals
- Been there forever
- Just admit they will be resurrected
- Keeps peace
- Prevents power vacuum

---

## The Summer Question

### When Bhau Started

**The Timeline:**
- By **15th of March** or end of March
- Bhau was on the march
- Nobody was sure: will Abdali stay in India during **summer**?
- That was the mystery

**Why It Mattered:**
- By end of March: **summer begins** in Indian subcontinent
- By time Bhau gets there (2-3 months)
- Will be by **May**
- May is **peak summer**

### Abdali's Pattern

**The History:**
- So far: Abdali had come to India 4-5 times
- But **never stayed** in summer months
- His army did **not like it**
- Not used to intense summer **heat**
- Not their typical weather
- Found it very **uneasy**

**The Uncertainty:**
> "That is why nobody was sure whether he will stay put in India by the time Sadashivrao reaches the northern frontier."

---

## Holkar's Guerrilla Tactics

### His Situation

**What Happened:**
- Holkar had **lost** the kind of battle (reference to Dattaji's death)
- But was in and around **Delhi**

**His Strategy:**
- Knew: cannot take Abdali's forces on **frontal warfare**
- One-on-one front
- Was doing the **Dhanmikawa** (guerrilla tactics)
- Surgical strike
- Go attack and come back
- That kind of stuff

**Why:**
- Didn't have the **courage**
- Neither does he have **wherewithal**
- To take him on frontal
- Too much to ask

**What He Was Doing:**
- **Harassing** Abdali

---

## The Realization: Abdali Will Stay

### At Mawa

**The Location:**
- Closer to **Narmada**
- Come a little distance away from the Khan (Deccan)
- Going towards **north**

**The Intel:**
- When got into Mawa
- Understood that Abdali **not going to go away**
- In summer month
- **Not** going back to Afghanistan
- Going to be some **clash** or **friction**

**The Reason:**
> "Because he's not going anywhere and I'm going to catch up with him. What is going to happen?"

**The Conclusion:**
- Got the intel
- This guy is going to **stay put**
- There is going to be a **battle**

---

## Geographic Context

**The Route:**
- **Patador** (near Aurangabad) → starting point
- **Udgir** → where Nizam battle was
- **Gambhir River** → took one month to cross
- **Agra** → 50 miles from Gambhir
- **Mawa** → where Bhau learned Abdali staying
- **Narmada** → closer to this area
- **Delhi** → ultimate destination

**The Rivers:**
- **Gambhir** → not major, tributary of Narmada
- **Narmada** → fairly broad and big
- **Yamuna** → Abdali already crossed
- **Ganga** → Abdali between this and Yamuna (Doab)
- **Sindhu, Jhelum, five rivers** → Abdali crossed all these

---

## Major Themes

### 1. The River Crossing Incompetence

**The Shocking Reality:**
- **One month** to cross Gambhir
- Not even a major river
- Just a tributary
- During monsoon (flooded)

**The Contrast:**
- Abdali crossed: Sindhu, Jhelum, five rivers, Yamuna
- Somehow mastered the **technique**
- Marathas: completely **inept**

**The Implication:**
- Major strategic weakness
- Would matter later
- Can't maneuver
- Geography constrains them
- Abdali has advantage

### 2. The Nizam Betrayal

**The Pattern:**
- Lose battle → agree to treaty
- Marathas leave → break treaty
- "What are you gonna do?"

**Why It Works:**
- Marathas in hurry
- Bigger priority (north)
- Can't enforce
- Nizam knows it
- Takes advantage

**The Frustration:**
- Bhau feels bad
- Knows it's wrong
- But can't do anything
- Priorities force choice
- Northern crisis > Nizam treaty

### 3. Raghunath Rao's Pride

**The Demand:**
- Lead or don't go
- Won't be second fiddle
- All or nothing

**The Reality:**
- Nanasaheb says no
- So he stays back
- But useful anyway
- Watching Nizam
- Keeping Karnataka secure

**The Subtext:**
- Ego prevents participation
- Major commander absent
- Because of pride
- Weakens northern campaign
- But someone needs to watch south

### 4. The 19-Year-Old Commander

**The Theory:**
- Vishwas Rao is namesake leader
- Gets experience
- Being groomed
- For future

**The Reality:**
- Bhau is real leader
- Everyone knows it
- Vishwas Rao defers to him
- Doesn't have experience

**The Purpose:**
- Training
- Succession planning
- Shows authority
- Decision-making practice

**The Tragedy:**
- Most handsome man in India
- 19 years old
- Will die at Panipat
- Afghans want to preserve him
- Display in Kabul
- Lost potential

### 5. The Mughal Resurrection Promise

**The Strategy:**
- Promise to resurrect Mughals
- Keep as namesake emperor
- Everyone comfortable with them
- Been there 300 years

**Why It Matters:**
- Prevents power vacuum
- Prevents infighting
- "Devil you know"
- Suraj Mal won't claim throne
- Suja won't claim throne
- Marathas won't claim throne
- Mughals acceptable to all

**The Reality:**
- Mughals "almost Indian" now
- Originally outsiders
- But 300 years = belong
- One of us
- Should protect them

### 6. The Summer Gamble

**The Hope:**
- Maybe Abdali will leave
- Like he always does
- Can't stand the heat
- Army not used to it
- Will go home

**The Reality:**
- This time: staying
- Breaking his pattern
- Willing to endure summer
- Shows: serious commitment
- Not just raid
- Real campaign

**The Implication:**
- Battle inevitable
- Can't wait him out
- Will have to fight
- In worst conditions
- Peak summer

### 7. Holkar's Guerrilla Wisdom

**What He's Doing:**
- Surgical strikes
- Hit and run
- Harassment
- Not frontal battle

**Why:**
- Doesn't have courage for frontal
- Doesn't have resources
- Too much to ask
- But can still be useful

**The Pattern:**
- Smart tactics
- Recognizes limits
- Doesn't seek glory
- Just does damage
- Stays alive

### 8. The Time Pressure

**The Constant:**
- No time to enforce Nizam treaty
- No time to wait for Abdali to leave
- No time for deliberation
- Urgent, urgent, urgent

**The Cost:**
- Makes worse decisions
- Can't address problems
- Can't build alliances properly
- Rushing
- Mistakes accumulate

### 9. The Afghan Technique Advantage

**What Abdali Has:**
- River crossing **technique**
- Mastered it
- Can cross:
  - Sindhu
  - Jhelum
  - Five rivers
  - Yamuna
  - With elephants, camels, horses, cannons, thousands of people

**What Marathas Don't Have:**
- Takes **one month** to cross tributary
- Completely inept
- No technique
- No training
- Major handicap

**Why It Matters:**
- Mobility
- Flexibility
- Strategic advantage
- Can maneuver
- Marathas can't

### 10. The Namesake vs. Real Power

**The Official Structure:**
- Vishwas Rao: commander in chief
- Has decision-making power
- Sovereign

**The Real Structure:**
- Bhau: actual leader
- Makes decisions
- Vishwas Rao defers to him
- Everyone knows it

**Why the Pretense:**
- Training Vishwas Rao
- Shows authority structure
- Political messaging
- Succession planning
- But doesn't fool anyone

---

## Critical Insights

### The One Month River Crossing

**The Numbers:**
- 30 days
- For tributary
- Not major river
- During monsoon (worst time)

**What It Shows:**
- Complete lack of preparation
- No training
- No technique
- No equipment
- Fundamental weakness

**The Comparison:**
- Abdali: crossed 5+ major rivers
- Easily
- With massive force
- Marathas: can't cross tributary
- In one month

**The Implication:**
- Not ready for northern campaign
- Geography will defeat them
- Before enemy does
- Fundamental incompetence

### The Abdali Stays Decision

**Why It Changes Everything:**
- Pattern: Abdali always leaves for summer
- This time: staying
- Shows: committed
- Not just raid
- Real war
- Willing to suffer

**The Impact:**
- Hope collapses
- Battle inevitable
- Can't wait him out
- Must fight
- Peak summer
- Worst conditions

**The Money:**
- Moneylenders won't lend
- If Abdali leaving: safe bet
- If Abdali staying: 50-50
- Too risky
- Wait and see
- Marathas starved of funds

### The Training vs. Reality Gap

**The Plan:**
- Vishwas Rao gets experience
- Under Bhau's tutelage
- Learn leadership
- Make decisions
- Ready to succeed Nanasaheb

**The Reality:**
- 19 years old
- Not enough experience
- Will defer to Bhau
- In crisis: Bhau decides

**The Problem:**
- If Bhau dies
- Who leads?
- 19-year-old with limited experience
- In middle of battle
- Recipe for disaster

**What Happens:**
- Both die at Panipat
- Army collapses
- No leadership
- Total rout
- Training incomplete

### The Nizam Lesson

**The Pattern:**
1. Fight Nizam
2. Win
3. Make treaty
4. Leave (urgently)
5. Nizam breaks treaty
6. Can't enforce

**The Lesson:**
- Treaties without enforcement = worthless
- Nizam knows they'll leave
- Waits them out
- Returns to old ways
- They can't do anything

**The Application:**
- Same will happen with everyone
- Make promises
- Can't enforce
- When leave north
- Promises meaningless
- Need permanent presence

### The Raghunath Rao Absence

**What He Brings:**
- Experience
- Senior leadership
- Northern knowledge (some)
- Major commander

**Why He's Not There:**
- Pride
- Won't be second fiddle
- All or nothing

**The Cost:**
- Major commander absent
- Bhau alone at top
- Less experience in north
- Weaker leadership team

**The Irony:**
- Staying to watch Nizam
- But Nizam breaking treaty anyway
- So his presence doesn't matter much
- Could be more useful in north

### The Handsome Trophy Plan

**The Afghan Thinking:**
- Vishwas Rao so handsome
- So young
- Preserve body
- Display in Kabul
- Like trophy

**What It Shows:**
- Dehumanization
- Trophy warfare
- Display of victory
- Intimidation tactic
- Cultural difference

**The Intervention:**
- Kashi Raj Pandit's plea
- Appeal to honor
- "King of kings"
- "Doesn't look good on you"
- Give proper burial
- Generous heart

**The Success:**
- Apparently worked
- Didn't preserve/display
- Shows: some honor code exists
- Can appeal to it
- Suja's influence helped

### The Mughal Comfort Blanket

**Why Keep Mughals:**
- Familiar
- 300 years
- Everyone comfortable
- No infighting

**The Logic:**
- Get rid of Mughals → power vacuum
- Everyone wants throne
- Suraj Mal, Suja, Marathas, etc.
- Infighting begins
- Chaos

**The Solution:**
- Keep Mughals (namesake)
- No one threatens others
- Acceptable to all
- Peace maintained

**The Irony:**
- Fighting to "protect" Mughals
- Actually fighting for Punjab
- Mughals are excuse
- Real issue: territory
- But useful fiction

### The Jat Fighting Heritage

**The Reputation:**
- Old community
- Battle-hardened
- Very good fighters
- Even today

**The Jat Sikhs:**
- Jats who converted
- Still proud of Jat heritage
- In Indian army
- Very well known
- Really the battle-hardening part

**The Application:**
- Suraj Mal Jat
- Comes from this tradition
- Explains his capability
- His survival
- His shrewdness

---

## What's Coming

**The Situation:**
- Bhau marching north
- Took one month to cross tributary
- Nizam breaking treaty behind him
- Raghunath Rao not with him (pride)
- 19-year-old Vishwas Rao as namesake leader
- Abdali staying for summer (breaking pattern)
- Battle inevitable
- Money problems looming
- Holkar doing guerrilla tactics

**The Questions:**
1. Can Bhau improve river crossing ability?
2. Will money shortage cripple campaign?
3. Can 19-year-old Vishwas Rao lead if needed?
4. Will Nizam cause problems from south?
5. Will Holkar's tactics help?
6. How will summer affect battle?

**The Trajectory:**
- Heading toward Panipat
- More river crossings ahead
- More financial problems
- More political problems
- Battle in peak summer
- Against well-supplied enemy
- Everything pointing toward disaster

---

**March-April 1760: It takes Bhau ONE MONTH to cross the Gambhir River. Not the Yamuna. Not the Narmada. Not even a major river. Just a tributary. One month. Meanwhile, Abdali has crossed the Sindhu, the Jhelum, five rivers in Punjab, the Yamuna, and made it into the Doab between Ganga and Yamuna. The Marathas are completely inept at river crossings. This is a fundamental weakness that will matter. Behind him, the Nizam is already breaking the treaty. "What are you gonna do? You're in a hurry, you have a big thing up north, screw you." Raghunath Rao refused to come because his pride wouldn't let him be second fiddle. So he's staying back to watch the Nizam, who's breaking treaties anyway. The 19-year-old Vishwas Rao is namesake commander in chief - most handsome man in entire India - but everyone knows Bhau is really in charge. And then at Mawa, the intel comes in: Abdali is staying for summer. Breaking his pattern. This time it's real. The battle is inevitable. The hope collapses. One month to cross a tributary. And they're heading north to fight the man who can cross five rivers with elephants and cannons.**
