# Maratha Strategy Failures & The Siege of Delhi (1757)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Shuja-ud-Daulah's Rejected Proposal

### The Request

**What He Asked:**
- Shuja-ud-Daulah **asked for help** to fight with Mughals
- Wanted Marathas on his side
- Against the Mughal Emperor

**The Maratha Response:**
> "It's not right to work on behalf of a subedar of a province against the Mughal court (Mughal Emperor)."

- Doesn't make sense
- Not the right way to go about it
- **Rejected his proposal**

**Why They Refused:**
- Marathas had gotten **victories through the medium of emperor**
- Made **alliance with him**
- Didn't want to **wreck that alliance**
- **He screwed up** (Shuja made bad move)

**The Hierarchy:**
- Emperor = **Sheriff in town** (big boss)
- Shuja-ud-Daulah = **small little nabab**
- Not worth betraying emperor for a provincial ruler

## Raghunath Rao's Letter to Sakharam Bapu

### Writing from Jaipur

**Who Sakharam Bapu Was:**
- In **Pune**
- One of the **important courtiers** in Nanasaheb Peshwa's court

**The Letter's Message:**

### On Shuja-ud-Daulah's Proposal

> "You have suggested that we should go help Shuja-ud-Daulah, but he won't give you any money. So how does it advance the interest of Peshwa?"

**The Rhetorical Question:**
- "**Sakharam**" = referring to his **older brother** (who happens to be Peshwa)
- If help Shuja-ud-Daulah **without monetary help**
- How will it **advance Peshwa's cause**?

**The Strategy:**
> "Wherever we get money, we go there and get new land, new areas as well. Every which way to get money is helpful to us as well as to the Sarkar (Nanasaheb Peshwa, Maratha Empire)."

---

## The Explicit Instructions (English Version)

### From the Book

**The Direct Quote:**

> "Abdali has left. Shuja is not offering a single rupee for Maratha help. Why then is help being offered? Go to the territories that yield money and that can be annexed. Get money for the state in whichever way you can."

**The Jaipur Reminder:**

> "It is due to Malhar Rao and his diwan Gangadhar Yashwant that here too, in Jaipur, this could not be achieved. So you should not fall prey to pressure and use all your ingenuity to get more money."

**The Context:**
- Remember: **Holkar tried to help** in Jaipur
- Didn't get **all the money promised**
- Reminding of that lesson

**The Bottom Line:**
- **Work only when we get paid**
- Don't fall for promises
- Get actual money

---

## The Soldiers of Fortune Strategy

### How Marathas Operated

**The Business Model:**
> "You can see the Maratha strategy was to... they were working like soldiers of fortune."

**Why This Made Them Unpopular:**
- **Not trying to develop their own power structure**
- Just **working for pay**
- **Working against them**
- Became **unpopular** partially because of this

**The Tough Situation:**
- Going **nationwide** (especially Northern India)
- Needed **military resources**
- **Soldiers' salaries**
- **War materials**
- **All of it needs money**

**Rock and a Hard Place:**
- Easy to be **desperate** like they were
- Couldn't help it
- But net effect: **not popular** where they were conquering

---

## The Detailed Instructions Continue

### More from Raghunath Rao's Letter

**The Core Message:**

> "Keep an army and join an endeavor that earns you something. We left Pune to obtain funds for the state and to this day have not got anything. This is a unique situation. I sent you ahead of me to capture territory and get funds, not to go and help somebody. Nor have I sent you for a pilgrimage to a holy place."

**The Strategy:**
- **Take over land**
- Start **controlling it ourselves**
- Put **governance structure** in place
- **Sure shot way** of getting money

**Why:**
- Once you take **governance in your hands**
- The **taxes will be owed to you**
- Don't depend on **somebody else giving it to you**

**The Clarification:**
> "I haven't sent anybody for the holy pilgrimage."

**Why This Matters:**
- Often when army went north
- They would **carry pilgrims** with them
- To visit **holy places** (in dangerous Mughal areas)
- Pilgrims wanted **protection**

**Making It Clear:**
- That's **not the aim** here
- Not a religious journey
- This is a **money-making expedition**

---

## The Debt Problem: Why This Matters

### Raghunath Rao's Financial Disaster

**The Critical Point:**
> "This is a very important point. From the second time when Raghunath Rao was sent to north to sort out issues, problems, when he came back, he had loans."

**The Failure:**
- Went north to **get money**
- Came back **in debt**
- Borrowed money to fund campaign
- **Didn't recover costs**
- **Major problem**

---

## The Temporary Army Problem

### Why Marathas Couldn't Stay

**The Reality:**
- Maratha soldiers were **temporary**
- Had families back in **Deccan/Pune**
- **Missing their own family members**
- **Not going to North forever**
- That **wasn't their intention**

**The Consequence:**
> "If you are going to come back, then you are not setting up a government and taking over the land and becoming part of the entire ecosystem there."

**The Problem:**
- Not establishing **permanent presence**
- Not building **administration**
- Not **integrating** into region
- **Part of the problem**

---

## The Looted North Problem

### Why Second Campaign Failed

**The Situation:**
> "He went to get money to the North, Raghunath Rao, but the North provinces were already looted. There was no wealth remaining."

**Why:**
- **Abdali wouldn't allow them to keep anything**
- Already stripped the region
- Nothing left to extract

**The Result:**
- Raghunath Rao **partially had nothing to gain**
- Went there **second time**
- Came back with **empty hands**
- **That was the problem**
- **Foolhardy errand**

---

## Crossing the Yamuna to Surajmal Jat

### The Geography

**The River:**
- Delhi mostly on **western bank of Yamuna**
- Surajmal Jat must be on **eastern bank of Yamuna**

**What Marathas Had to Do:**
- **Cross Yamuna River** from west to east
- To get to Surajmal Jat
- **Trying to get money** from him

---

## Conquering the Doab (July 1757)

### The Territory Between Two Rivers

**What is Doab:**
- **"Do" = two**
- **"Ab" = water/river**
- **Doab = land between two rivers**
- Between **Yamuna and Ganga**

**The Geography:**
- **Delhi** on western bank of Yamuna
- To get to Doab: **cross Yamuna River**
- **Ganga River** is to the east of Yamuna
- Yamuna comes and **meets with Ganga from western side**
- Area between them = **Doab**

**What Happened (July 1757):**
- **Anupshahr** town - Raghunath Rao set up control
- Marathas **won over many cities and towns** in Doab
- Once crossed eastern bank of Yamuna
- Entered Doab territory
- Took control

---

## The Power Shift in Delhi

### Wazir Imad ul-Mulk Takes Charge

**What Happened:**
- **Wazir Imad ul-Mulk** put his hand in with Marathas
- Asked Marathas to **get rid of Najib Khan**
- Because he was **loyal ally of Abdali**
- Now that Abdali gone, wanted Najib **gone too**

**Najib Khan:**
- Was the **Mir Bakshi**
- **Removed and kicked out** from Delhi

**Ahmad Khan Bangash:**
- From **Farrukhabad**
- Thought he would **become Mir Bakshi**
- Followed in footsteps (**kitta girawla**) of Imad ul-Mulk
- Remember: Imad ul-Mulk also became **Mir Bakshi**
- Then became **Wazir** (took both roles)
- Bangash doing same - following same path

---

## The Siege of Delhi (July 1757)

### Surrounding the Capital

**Who Arrived:**
- Both **Sakharam Bapu** and **Raghunath Rao**
- Reached banks of Yamuna
- In that town
- **July 1757**

**The Siege:**
- Within a month
- **Laid siege to Delhi**
- **Stopped all incoming, outgoing** stuff from Delhi
- **Nothing could get out**
- **Nothing could come in**

**Najib's Response:**
- Started **preparations for defending Delhi**

**The Alliance Shift:**
- Imad had made **treaty/alliance** with Marathas
- Because of this
- Relations with **Shuja-ud-Daulah became bad**

---

## The Holy Cities Goal

### What Raghunath Rao Wanted

**The Objective:**
- Get control of **Hindu holy cities**

**Which Cities:**

1. **Kashi** (Varanasi)
   - **Vishwanath Temple** in Kashi
   
2. **Mathura**
   - Krishna's birthplace
   
3. **Prayagraj** (Allahabad)
   - Where **three rivers meet**
   - Two visible: **Ganga and Yamuna**
   - Third: **Saraswati** (mythical, underground now)
   - For practical purposes: **two rivers meeting**
   - Town at banks, then becomes **Ganga**

**Ayodhya:**
- Is holy
- But at the time **not much in Ayodhya**
- Nobody talks about it at this moment
- Only had **that mosque**
- Not a focus

**The Geography:**
- Ganga and Yamuna **start in Himalayas**
- Yamuna is **west of Ganga**
- Once in plains: area between = **Doab**
- **Incredibly fertile**
- Doab **ends at Prayagraj** (where rivers meet)

---

## The Shuja-ud-Daulah Problem

### Why It Was Difficult

**The Situation:**
- Marathas wanted **control of these towns**
- Get some kind of **autonomy**
- Now **difficult**

**Why:**
- Shuja-ud-Daulah wanted **friendship with Marathas**
- But Marathas said: **"We're sticking with our alliance with emperor and wazir"**
- So obviously Shuja said:
  - "If you're going to stick with my opponents"
  - "So be it"
  - "I don't want to help you or do anything good for you"

**The Cost:**
- **Lost potential ally**
- Made enemy of powerful nabab
- For sake of emperor alliance

---

### The Religious Teacher's Revenge

**Who Kutub Shah Was:**
- **Najib Khan's guru** (teacher)
- **Religious guru/teacher** to Najib Khan
- Important figure (will come up later)

**What Happened:**
- Because **Imad was against Najib Khan**
- Kutub Shah just **raided Imad's residence**
- Took his **revenge**

**The Atrocities:**
- **Killed everyone there**
- **Mistreated women**
- Took away **valuables**

**The Result:**
> "Because of that, Imad became like a total enemy of Najib Khan. Bitter enemies."

**Why:**

- Women mistreated
- Valuables stolen
- Destruction everywhere
- **Not going to go well** with Imad

**The Rift:**

---

## Critical Insights

### The Soldiers of Fortune Problem

**The Strategy:**
- Work for **money only**
- Don't build **permanent structures**
- Don't create **governance**
- **Temporary presence**

**Why It Doesn't Work:**
1. **Unpopular** where conquering
2. **No loyalty** from locals
3. **Can't hold** territory
4. **Temporary** armies go home
5. **Not integrating** into region

**The Dilemma:**
- Need money **to campaign**
- Need to campaign **to get money**
- But spending money **on campaigns**
- Not investing in **administration**
- **Vicious cycle**

### The Debt Disaster

**The Critical Failure:**
- Raghunath Rao went north **second time**
- Purpose: **get money**
- Result: **came back with loans**
- **Borrowed to fund** campaign
- **Didn't recover** costs

**Why This Matters:**
- **Unsustainable** model
- Each campaign **costs more** than it earns
- Going **deeper in debt**
- Eventually **can't fund** more campaigns
- **Death spiral**

### The Looted North Problem

**The Situation:**
- Abdali **already stripped** North India
- **No wealth remaining**
- Nothing left to extract
- **Foolhardy errand**

**The Irony:**
- Went to **get money**
- But Abdali **took it all**
- Chasing **empty treasury**
- **Should have known** this

**The Lesson:**
- Can't extract **what isn't there**
- Abdali **beat them to it**
- Wrong timing
- Wrong strategy

### The Temporary Army Problem

**Why They Can't Stay:**
- Soldiers **miss families** (back in Deccan/Pune)
- Not going to **North forever**
- **Not their intention**
- Want to **go home**

**The Consequence:**
- **Not setting up government**
- **Not taking over land**
- **Not integrating** into ecosystem
- **Part of the problem**

**The Fundamental Issue:**
- Can't **conquer and hold** with temporary army
- Need **permanent garrison**
- Need **settlers**, not raiders
- Need **administration**, not occupation

### The Holy Cities Strategy

**Why It Matters:**
- Control **Hindu holy sites**
- Gives **religious legitimacy**
- Shows **protecting Hinduism**
- Not just **mercenaries**

**The Three Cities:**
1. **Kashi/Varanasi** - Vishwanath Temple (most sacred)
2. **Mathura** - Krishna's birthplace (just massacred by Abdali)
3. **Prayagraj** - where rivers meet (pilgrimage site)

**The Politics:**
- If control **holy cities**
- Hindus see as **protectors**
- **Legitimacy** for rule
- Not just **soldiers of fortune**

**But:**
- Shuja-ud-Daulah now **hostile**
- Controls some of this territory
- Made **harder** by diplomatic failure

### The Kutub Shah Raid

**What Happened:**
- Najib's **guru** (teacher)
- Raided **Imad's residence**
- **Killed** everyone
- **Mistreated women**
- **Stole valuables**
- **Destroyed** everything

**The Impact:**
- Created **permanent rift**
- Imad and Najib now **bitter enemies**
- **Personal** now, not just political
- Women mistreated = **unforgivable**

**Why It Matters Later:**
- Kutub Shah **important figure** going forward
- This **rift** will have consequences
- Najib-Imad **feud** will shape events
- **Religious violence** mixing with politics

### The Doab: Geography is Destiny

**Why Doab Matters:**
- **Incredibly fertile** land
- Between **two rivers** (Yamuna, Ganga)
- **Wealth** of region
- **Strategic** importance

**The Control:**
- Marathas **conquering** Doab in July 1757
- Taking **many towns and cities**
- **Anupshahr** as base
- Establishing **presence**

**The Geography:**
- Must **cross Yamuna** to reach Doab
- **Rivers as barriers** (especially during monsoon)
- **No bridges** in this era
- **Control crossings** = control region

### The Siege Strategy

**What They Did:**
- **Stopped all incoming/outgoing** from Delhi
- **Nothing in, nothing out**
- **Within a month** of arriving
- **Complete siege**

**The Goal:**
- **Starve them out**
- Force **surrender**
- **Remove Najib Khan**
- Install **friendly government**

**Najib's Response:**
- **Preparations for defense**
- But already **kicked out** as Mir Bakshi
- **Weakened position**
- Need to **defend**

### The Shuja-ud-Daulah Failure

**The Diplomatic Blunder:**
- Shuja wanted **friendship**
- Marathas chose **emperor over him**
- He becomes **hostile**
- "If you're with my opponents, so be it"

**The Cost:**
- **Lost powerful ally**
- Awadh Nawab = **major player**
- Controls **strategic territory**
- Now he **won't help**
- Might **actively oppose**

**The Reason:**
- Loyalty to **1752 treaty** with emperor
- But emperor is **powerless**
- Shuja is **powerful nabab**
- **Strategic mistake**?

### The Instructions: Money Money Money

**The Explicit Orders:**
- "**Work only when we get paid**"
- "Go to territories that **yield money**"
- "Get money in **whichever way you can**"
- "Don't help people **for free**"
- "This is not a **pilgrimage**"

**The Reminder:**
- Holkar **didn't get paid** in Jaipur
- **Don't fall for promises**
- Get **actual money**
- Use **all your ingenuity**

**The Desperation:**
- "We left Pune to get funds"
- "**To this day have not got anything**"
- "This is a **unique situation**"
- Clear **failure** admitted

**The Strategy:**
- **Take over land directly**
- **Control governance**
- Taxes **owed to you**
- Don't depend on **others giving it**

---

## Foreshadowing

**What This Sets Up:**

1. **Siege of Delhi ongoing** - will Najib surrender?
2. **Kutub Shah will return** - important later
3. **Najib-Imad bitter enemies** - permanent rift
4. **Shuja-ud-Daulah hostile** - lost ally
5. **Doab under control** - Maratha presence established
6. **Holy cities goal** - trying to get legitimacy
7. **Debt problem** - Raghunath Rao in loans
8. **Temporary army issue** - can't hold territory
9. **Soldiers of fortune** - unpopular strategy
10. **Money obsession** - will drive decisions
11. **Ahmad Khan Bangash** - following Imad's path to power

**The Questions:**
- Will siege succeed?
- Can they establish permanent governance?
- Will they control holy cities?
- How will debt problem resolve?
- When will temporary army go home?
- Will Najib Khan return?
- What will Kutub Shah do?
- Can they make Shuja an ally again?

---

**1757: From Jaipur, Raghunath Rao writes to Sakharam Bapu: "Shuja won't pay us. Why help him? Go where the money is. Take over land directly - control the taxes yourself. Remember Jaipur? Holkar didn't get paid. Don't fall for that. Work only when we get paid. This is not a pilgrimage." The instructions are explicit: money above all. But there's a problem - the North has been looted by Abdali. Nothing left. Raghunath Rao came back from his first campaign with LOANS. Went to get money, came back in debt. And the army wants to go home - missing families, not staying forever. Can't build permanent structures with temporary soldiers. In July, they cross the Yamuna, conquer Doab, take Anupshahr. Lay siege to Delhi within a month - nothing in, nothing out. Najib Khan kicked out as Mir Bakshi. But then Kutub Shah - Najib's religious teacher - raids Imad's residence. Kills everyone, mistreats women, steals everything. Creates permanent rift. Bitter enemies now. And Shuja-ud-Daulah wanted friendship, but Marathas stuck with the emperor. So he's hostile now. "If you're with my opponents, fine. I won't help you." Lost another ally. Working as soldiers of fortune, unpopular everywhere. Going deeper in debt. Temporary army that wants to go home. And everyone saying: "They just care about money, not governance." The model isn't working. But they can't stop. Need money for the next campaign. Vicious cycle.**
