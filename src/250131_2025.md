# Delhi Under Maratha Control: The Political Standoff at Yamuna
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Machinations Behind Delhi's Fall

**The Secret Deal:**
- Suraj Mal & Imad-ul-Mulk made a proposal to each other
- Suraj Mal promised to give Imad the Delhi fort + Wazir position
- In exchange, Imad would give Suraj Mal the Agra province
- Plan was to take Agra's taxes away from Marathas (who controlled it)

**Why Bahu Rejected It:**
- Bahu learned of the machinations
- Refused to allow this rearrangement
- Had his own plans for Delhi

**The Fallout:**
- Suraj Mal became disturbed (his plan blocked)
- Gangadhar Tatya & Ramaji Anand (Suraj Mal's advisors) even more upset
- They had **taken bribes** from Imad for promising his wazir position
- Now faced angry creditors with no delivery on promise
- **This is why Suraj Mal abandoned the fight** (when he realized Bahu's true intention)

## Bahu's Victory, But At What Cost?

**The Reputational Gains:**
- Taking Delhi fort = huge boost to prestige
- Everyone in India now knew Marathas controlled Delhi seat of power
- Proof of Maratha dominance over Mughal structure
- Massive psychological impact

**The Financial Disaster:**
- Delhi treasury was empty
- Previous rulers had looted everything
- Mughal empire had extracted all wealth
- **No money to pay army, no money to feed campaign**

**The New Burden:**
- Emperor's family now seeking protection in fort
- Religious pilgrims and seekers expecting Maratha protection
- Elderly people depending on Maratha resources
- **Bahu responsible for all of them**

**The Daily Cost:**
- Over 100,000 daily expense (currency units)
- Had to feed soldiers AND civilians AND dependents
- Had to pay salaries (especially artillery)
- Couldn't use Delhi's resources because there were none

## The Gardi Payment Problem

**The Critical Obligation:**
- Ibrahim Khan Gardi commanded ~9,000-10,000 artillery men
- This was Maratha's most critical military asset
- Contract: **Must be paid regularly, no exceptions**
- Could defer soldier salaries somewhat
- **Could NOT defer Gardi payment**

**Why This Mattered:**
- Artillery was Bahu's entire strategy
- Gardi men were hand-picked, trained, essential
- If unpaid, would defect or refuse to fight
- This was the #1 bargain Bahu made to get Gardi's expertise
- **Non-negotiable commitment**

---

## The Abdali Camp's Reaction

**When News of Delhi Conquest Reached Them:**
- Abdali's camp fell into depression
- Realized Marathas now controlled seat of power
- Delhi = symbol of imperial authority
- This looked like Maratha empire taking over Mughal empire

**The Psychological Impact:**
- Afghans saw their Mughal allies now serving Marathas
- All vassal kingdoms across India now under Maratha shadow
- Tremendous boost to Maratha self-confidence
- Created urgency for Abdali to act decisively

**Letters of Praise:**
- Nana Fadnis (scribe) wrote to Peshwa praising Bahu
- Referenced Bahu's wisdom, bravery, strategic brilliance
- Everyone lavishing praise for this accomplishment
- Reputation boost was real (even if finances weren't)

## The Yamuna Standoff: Geography as Politics

**The Setup:**
- Delhi on west bank of Yamuna
- Shahadara encampment on east bank (Suja's forces)
- Abdali & Najib Khan camped further east (Anupshar)
- Marathas took possession of all boats
- **Couldn't build boat bridge without boats**

**Abdali's Humiliation:**
- Yakub Khan (Red Fort defender) was looking to Abdali for rescue
- Abdali could do nothing—separated by Yamuna
- Was powerless to save his ally
- **Point of honor—seen as weak and ineffectual**
- This insulted Abdali and forced his hand

**The Maratha Strategy:**
- Set up small military camps at all possible crossing points
- Purpose: Spy, not defend (camps were token forces)
- Alert Bahu if Abdali attempts crossing
- Try to catch Abdali in most vulnerable moment (mid-crossing)

**The Cat & Mouse Game:**
- Abdali wanted to keep crossing location secret
- Marathas trying to discover where he'd cross
- Both armies could see each other but couldn't engage
- Occasional long-range cannon fire (inaccurate, ineffective)

**Why Cannon Duels Failed:**
- Guns of era were extremely imprecise
- Distance: 2-3 km (beyond effective range)
- If someone got hit, it was by accident, not design
- Couldn't pin down enemy at that distance
- So artillery was useless for Yamuna standoff

---

## The Peace Emissaries

**Who Wanted War:**
- Abdali had to act (honor compromised by inaction)
- Marathas committed to campaign (spent resources, reputational)

**Who Wanted Peace:**
- **Suja wanted desperately to avoid war**
- Realized if Marathas won: loss of power to them
- Realized if Abdali won: loss of power to him
- **Either way, Suja had nothing to gain, everything to lose**
- Sent diplomats constantly between camps

**The Peace Negotiations:**
- Lawyers/diplomats going back and forth
- Trying to find middle ground
- Suja was central party to peace efforts
- Offered to broker deals (you get this, I get that)

**Why Peace Failed:**
- Abdali's honor required action
- Marathas' investment required results
- Suja's offers couldn't satisfy both sides simultaneously
- Geographic situation (armies facing each other) was unsustainable

---

## The Elephant Recovery

**The Historical Grievance:**
- Precious Maratha war elephant taken by Afghans as booty earlier
- Found it in Red Fort when captured
- **Emotional victory**—reclaimed cultural/military asset
- Symbolic of Maratha restoration

**But Hollow Victory:**
- Trophy elephant ≠ payment for troops
- Doesn't solve financial crisis
- Doesn't feed 100,000+ people daily
- Doesn't substitute for Delhi's empty treasury

---

## Delhi: The Empty Prize

**Why Delhi Mattered:**
- Seat of Mughal power
- Center of all imperial authority
- Symbol of control over India
- Proof that Marathas could conquer anything

**Why Delhi Disappointed:**
- Treasury looted by previous rulers
- No immediate revenue
- Came with dependents and defense obligations
- Created costs without offsetting income

**The Political vs. Financial Reality:**
- Politically: Huge success
- Financially: Massive drain
- Reputationally: Incredible boost
- Practically: Disaster for campaign logistics

---

## Why War Became Inevitable

**Geographic Factors:**
- Two armies facing each other at Yamuna
- Can't bypass without fighting
- Can't ignore without losing face
- Paths completely blocked

**Political Factors:**
- Abdali's honor demanded action
- Marathas' investment demanded results
- Suja's survival required someone to win decisively
- Too many ambitions, not enough room

**Economic Factors:**
- Marathas had no more resources
- Couldn't wait indefinitely
- Couldn't advance without Abdali moving
- Couldn't retreat without humiliation

**The Conclusion:**
- War wasn't chosen—it was inevitable consequence of circumstances
- Both commanders knew it would be devastating
- Both wanted to avoid it
- Neither could do anything but fight

## The Political Complexity

**On Yamuna's Western Bank:**
- Marathas with artillery, full force
- Daily expense: 100,000+
- Controlling Delhi, fort, symbolism
- But: Empty treasury, unpaid soldiers, growing desperation

**On Yamuna's Eastern Bank:**
- Abdali with full Afghan army
- Wanting to go home (tired, supplies running out)
- Honor compromised by inaction
- But: Can't cross without losing soldiers, can't stay indefinitely

**Between the Banks:**
- Suja trying to negotiate peace
- Diplomats going back and forth
- Everyone seeking middle ground that doesn't exist
- Geography makes war inevitable

---

## Key Insight

**The Yamuna as Symbol:**
- Represents everything dividing the two armies
- Represents the political/cultural divide (Hindu vs. Afghan)
- Represents the geographic reality that force must decide
- Boats controlled by Marathas = Maratha advantage that Abdali will negate by crossing

**When Abdali Crosses:**
- Advantage shifts
- Standoff becomes confrontation
- Negotiation becomes violence
- Everything changes

---

**Where We Left Off:** Marathas have captured Delhi (reputation enhanced, treasury empty, new dependents added) and are controlling Yamuna crossing points. Abdali is stuck on east side but desperate to act. Suja is trying to negotiate peace but failing. Everyone knows war is coming—the only question is when Abdali will make his move and break the Yamuna standoff.

---

*Delhi was supposed to be the prize that gave Marathas the resources to fight Abdali. Instead, it became the prize that consumed their remaining resources. They got the symbol but not the substance. And now they're trapped on the western bank of Yamuna, controlling all the boats but watching an enemy army that won't be contained by water forever. The standoff can't last. When Abdali moves, everything changes.*
