- In that campaign
- **Dattaji did not participate**

**Why:**
- Probably assigned to **different area**
- Just didn't have time
- Or was **not asked** to participate

**Correction:**
- After victory in Jodhpur

## The December 17, 1758 Letter

### Three Big Tasks

**From:** Nana Saheb Peshwa  
**To:** Amatya Ramaji Ananta (probably based in Delhi)  
**Date:** December 17, 1758

**The Context:**
- By this time, **Abdali had come** to Delhi
- **Destroyed Delhi**
- Wanted to get all the money he could
- In **Mathura**: murders, killings, **barbaric behavior**
- Then went back to Afghanistan

**But Before Leaving:**
- Made sure **Najeeb Khan Rohila** would be appointed
- As important personality
- Made **Mir Bakshi**

---

## Najeeb Khan's Ambition

### The Power Play

**His Goal:**
- **Ambition**: become **Wazir** himself

**Current Position:**
- Right now: made **Mir Bakshi**

**The Letter's Instructions:**
> "Take the side of the **Wazir** in Delhi and **destroy Najeeb Khan Rohila**."

**Translation:**
- Team up against him
- By teaming up against him
- Destruction or total **termination**

---

## The Adina Beg Problem

### Dead on Arrival

**The Background:**
- Remember: Raghunath Rao appointed **Adina Beg**
- As **Subedar of Punjab**
- When he decided to come back

**The Problem:**
> "He's just **no more**. He's **dead**."

**Why This Matters:**
- Have to have **good presence**
- And **control** over Punjab
- Adina Beg can't control everything by himself
- He needs **help**

**Peshwa Knew:**
- Abdali has **one eye on Punjab all the time**

**The Solution:**
> "Make sure you give him proper **supplement**. I'm assigning **Dattaji Shinde** to make sure he will be able to give proper **protection** to Adina Beg or to Punjab."

**The Duty:**
- Make sure if Punjab needs help
- In case of **Abdali's invasion**
- Dattaji will be **fulfilling that duty**

---

## The Bengal Task

### Still Hope?

**The Instruction:**
> "The task in establishing control in **Bengal** is also important."

**The Timing Question:**
- This letter: December 1758
- Or actually maybe **December 17, 1758** (was written as 1656, error)
- Battle of Plassey: **1757**
- So Peshwa must **know about it**

**What Peshwa Wants:**
- Probably wants Dattaji to **get rid of British influence** in Bengal

**The Reality:**
- Britishers were still trying to **put their influence** in Bengal
- They were **not completely done** yet
- Still a little **progress** to go

**The Hope:**
> "Peshwa knew that there is **scope to make money** in Bengal. So Bengal is prosperous province. If Dattaji can establish our **rule** or at least have some **partial control**, then we can **make money** off of Bengal and some of our **loan issues will go down**."

---

## The Awadh Alliance

### Shuja ud-Daula

**The Instruction:**
- Can take help from **Shuja ud-Daula of Awadh**
- Shuja ud-Daula = **Nawab of Awadh**
- Awadh = one of **very prosperous provinces**

**The Plan:**
- Can ask Shuja ud-Daula to **help us with his army**
- In case **Mansoor Khan** needs it in Punjab

**Who Is Mansoor Khan:**
- The **son-in-law** of Adina Beg
- He tries to **succeed** Adina Beg
- (After Adina Beg died)

---

## Dattaji's Determination

### Once He Sets His Mind

**The Assessment:**
> "If Dattaji takes upon his mind, **he will do it**. Dattaji is a very **capable personality**. Once he says 'I will do this' or he wants to do something, he will **not let anything come in between**."

**Translation:**
- Once he **sets his mind to it**
- He **will do it**
- He has that kind of **mindset**

**The Confidence:**
> "Once we have Dattaji and some other things, we **don't need anybody else**."

---

## The Holy Places

### Kashi, Mathura

**The Goal:**
- Thinking about **rescuing** Kashi, Mathura
- And all these **holy places**
- From the **Islamic influence**

**Why:**
- Hindus could not go there
- And be **without any concerns**
- Because they were in **enemy territory**

---

## The Bottom Line

### What Peshwa Really Wants

**The Summary:**
> "In summary: **I need money**. Because I have a lot of **loan to repay**. Make sure that you **make money** and send it **my way**."

**Why:**
- He is **saddled with all the loans**
- He knows the only way money can come to him
- Is from the **north**
- **He needs the money**

---

## The Three Tasks

### Peshwa's Priorities

**Task 1: Bengal**
> "Get to Bengal and there is **lots of money** there. You can get **tributes** or you can **loot** the people, whatever it takes. But Bengal is **our place** because it is **prosperous**."

**Task 2: Punjab**
> "Punjab is **dicey** because Abdali has his **eye on it**. Make sure that you **beef up** Mansoor Khan or whoever that guy is after Adina Beg. Punjab also is **prosperous**."

**Task 3: Holy Places**
> "Some of the **holy places** that are under **Muslim influence**, try to **rescue** them. Because Hindus could not go there without concerns."

**The Real Goal:**
> "Ultimately in summary: **I need money. Send it my way.**"

---

## December 24 Letter

## Critical Insights

### Why Dattaji Was Chosen

**His Qualities:**
1. **Decisive** - no confusion
2. **Accomplished** - proven track record
3. **Loyal** - fulfilled duties with loyalty
4. **Capable** - very capable commander
5. **Determined** - won't let anything come in between

**What Peshwa Needed:**
- Someone who could **handle multiple tasks**
- **Bengal** + **Punjab** + **Holy places**
- Someone **independent** (doesn't need others)
- Someone **trustworthy** with money

---

### The Bengal Miscalculation

**The Hope:**
> "Still scope to make money in Bengal."

**The Reality:**
- Battle of Plassey: **1757**
- This letter: **December 1758**
- **Over a year later**
- British already **consolidating**

**The Delusion:**
- Thinking there's still **partial control** possible
- British not "completely done"
- Can still **loot** or get **tributes**

**The Truth:**
- Probably **too late**
- British have **disciplined army**
- Mir Jafar is **puppet**
- Real power: **British**

---

### The Money Math

**The Sources:**
1. **Bengal** - most prosperous (but lost to British)
2. **Punjab** - prosperous (but Abdali has eye on it)
3. **Delhi/North** - impoverished (Abdali already looted it)

**The Problem:**
- Best source (**Bengal**) = **gone**
- Second source (**Punjab**) = **dicey**
- Third source (**Delhi**) = **already looted**

**The Reality:**
> Where is the money going to come from?

---

### The Three-Task Impossibility

**Task 1:** Get to **Bengal** (far east)
- Fight British
- Establish control
- Extract money

**Task 2:** Secure **Punjab** (far northwest)
- Protect from Abdali
- Beef up defenses
- Keep it prosperous

**Task 3:** Rescue **holy places**
- Kashi, Mathura, etc.
- Throughout north
- From Islamic control

**The Geographic Spread:**
- Bengal = **extreme east**
- Punjab = **extreme northwest**
- Holy places = **scattered throughout**

**The Question:**
> How can one commander do all three?

---

### The Najeeb Khan Dilemma

**The Instruction:**
- **Destroy** Najeeb Khan
- Team up with Wazir against him

**The Reality:**
- Najeeb Khan has **protection** (we'll see)
- Ambitious and capable
- Made **Mir Bakshi** by Abdali
- Has Afghan **backing**

**The Complication:**
- Easier said than done
- Will create **problems** trying

---

## Foreshadowing

### What's Coming

**The Money Problem:**
- Loans **ballooning**
- Main sources **gone or vulnerable**
- Bengal lost to **British**
- Punjab threatened by **Abdali**
- Delhi already **looted**
- Where's the money?

**The Three Tasks:**
- **Impossible** to do all three
- Will have to **prioritize**
- Something will **suffer**
- Likely: **can't secure Bengal**

**The Najeeb Khan Problem:**
- Ordered to **destroy** him
- But he has **protection** (Holkar)
- Will this create **conflict**?

**The Dattaji Pressure:**
- Lots of **expectations**
- "Don't need anybody else"
- Multiple fronts
- **Geographic impossibility**
- What happens when he **can't** deliver?

**The Bengal Reality:**
- Probably **already too late**
- British **consolidating**
- Disciplined army
- Not going anywhere
- Peshwa might not accept this

---

**August 17, 1759: Dattaji Shinde writes to Nana Saheb Peshwa. "You're saddled with loans. I'm worried about it day and night. Whatever we get that can help you repay, we'll send your way." The acknowledgment of the crisis. Meanwhile, Peshwa already sent his instructions (December 1758). Three big tasks: Get to Bengal (lots of money there, loot if you have to), secure Punjab (Abdali has his eye on it, beef up Mansoor Khan after Adina Beg died), rescue holy places (from Islamic control). Bottom line in summary: I NEED MONEY. Send it my way. Because he's saddled with all the loans. Only source: the north. But Bengal's already gone (British took it in 1757). Still hoping for partial control? Too late probably. Britishers consolidating. Punjab dicey (Abdali watching). Delhi looted (Abdali already destroyed it). Where's the money going to come from? And Dattaji has to do all three? Bengal (extreme east), Punjab (extreme northwest), holy places (scattered everywhere)? Geographic impossibility. But Peshwa confident: "Once we have Dattaji, don't need anybody else. He's decisive. Once he sets his mind, he'll do it. Won't let anything come in between." The Soldier of God gets his orders. Three impossible tasks. One urgent need: money. The pressure is on.**
