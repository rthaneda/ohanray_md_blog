## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Abdali Joins Najib (Late December 1759)

### The Union of Forces

**After Crossing Yamuna:**
- Abdali went to **Saharanpur**
- Joined **Najib Khan**
- **Rohila Khand** location

**Who Are the Rohilas:**
- Najib Khan's allies
- Other Rohilla commanders
- Afghan ethnic group in India

---

## Holkar's Ideology: Old-School Warfare

### His Belief About Abdali

**What Holkar Thought:**
> "Abdali was overrated."

**His Assessment:**
- Didn't believe Abdali was that dangerous
- Thought people exaggerated his capability
- This was **wrong assessment**

**What Holkar Used to Say:**
- To Abdali: "You will be the first one to be shot if at all"
- "You are the celebrity, right?"
- Used to **belittle** Abdali
- Said Abdali "has no real guts to be leader of battle formation"

**The Reality:**
> "Dattaji turned out to be wrong and Abdali turned out to be correct."

**Foreshadowing:**
- This will come back in future chapters
- Holkar's underestimation will matter
- We're just getting warmed up
- Actual battle is far away
- But something may be happening soon

---

## The Winter Problem

### Height of Winter in North India

**The Climate Reality:**
- **December 1759** - peak winter
- North India = very cold
- Marathas **not accustomed to cold**
- Their **flimsy clothes**

**The Maratha Disadvantage:**
- Came from the **Deccan (Khan)**
- Much warmer and hotter place
- **Not used to winter business**

**Why Their Clothes Were Flimsy:**
- In Deccan, resist heat by wearing less
- Put as **little clothes as possible**
- Makes sense in hot climate
- **Terrible** in north India winter

### The Fog Factor

**North India Winter Conditions:**
- **Thick fog** in morning hours
- Especially winter months (3 months)
- Until 11 or 12 o'clock
- Then sun disperses it

**The Impact:**
- **Visibility affected**
- Heavy thick fog cover
- Even today this happens
- Tactical disadvantage

**Climate Notes:**
- Very conducive for fog formation
- Consistent phenomenon
- Predictable but unavoidable

---

## Afghan Climate Advantage

### The Preparation

**Why Afghans Were Ready:**
- Coming from **colder climate**
- Usually carried **protective clothing**
- Used to cold weather

**The Home Advantage:**
- Afghanistan much colder than north India
- For them, north India winter = mild
- Their **attire adjusted** for Afghan weather
- Even colder than nearby areas

**The Result:**
- **Not affected** by cold
- No big deal for them
- Ready for conditions
- While Marathas suffered

---

## The River Defense Strategy

### Burari Ghat: The Critical Point

**Who Was There:**
- **Sabaji Shinde** held post
- Burari Ghat location
- Just north of Delhi

**Why This Location:**
- To **prevent Abdali from crossing Yamuna**
- The **ghat** = slope of Yamuna river
- Where Abdali could come up if crossing

**The Strategy:**
> "If you catch him while he is crossing, then you can destroy his army when it is most vulnerable."

- Really take them out
- Best place to be situated
- Catch enemy at weakest moment

### Dattaji's Position: Majnu Katila

**Where He Was:**
- **Just south** of Burari Ghat
- Also at a ghat (Majnu Katila)
- On Yamuna's **west bank**

**The Coordination:**
- Dattaji south of Sabaji
- Both covering Yamuna crossings
- **Best guess**: Abdali will cross river
- Come over to Burari Ghat

**The Logic:**
- Catch enemy where most vulnerable
- While crossing river
- Can't fight back effectively
- Destroy the army
- **Guessing game** though

---

## Malhar Rao Holkar: Still in Rajasthan

### The Tribute Business

**What He Was Doing:**
- Trying to **close his affair in Rajasthan**
- Getting **pending tributes** from Madho Singh
- Trying to capture **Fort of Barwada**

**Barwada Location:**
- Called south
- Between **Tonk and Sawai Madhopur**
- Southeast of Jaipur city
- Nearly **175 kilometers from Delhi**

**The Problem:**
- **Not far** from where action was
- Hide and seek between Abdali and Dattaji
- If he had **dropped tribute business**
- Could have come **just in time**

---

## Madho Singh's Secret Alliance

### Working with Najib Khan

**The Conspiracy:**
- Madho Singh working in **secret conjunction** with Najib Khan
- **Detained Holkar in Rajasthan**
- By offering **stiff resistance**

**The Strategy:**
- Keeping Holkar busy
- Instead of letting him easily go north
- In **cahoots** with Abdali and Najib
- But **no one knew it at the time**

### The Fort Siege

**December 1759:**
- Holkar brought his guns
- Forced fort to **capitulate**
- In **mid-December 1759**

**Meanwhile:**
- When Dattaji crossed Yamuna to face Abdali
- Holkar still busy with siege
- Getting some results
- But wasting time

---

## The Holkar Problem: A Troublesome Figure

### His Character Assessment

**General View:**
> "Malhar Rao is also troublesome figure. You will see later on also."

**The Accusation:**
- A lot of people say
- He **didn't play proper role** in actual battle
- **Let down the Marathas**

**Why:**
1. Had **soft corner for Najib Khan**
2. Was an **old timer**

### The Age Factor

**His Age:**
- At the time: **50 plus**
- **Not in his prime** fighting age

**What This Means:**
- Less aggressive
- More cautious
- Not as capable physically
- Different priorities

---

## Holkar's Warfare Ideology

### Trained Under Bajirao I

**His Background:**
- Was **aid to Bajirao I**
- Went on northern campaigns with him
- Saw Bajirao in action
- **Bajirao was his teacher**

**His Ideology Matured During Bajirao I's Time:**
- That's when he learned warfare
- Formed his tactical beliefs
- Based on Bajirao's methods

### The Old-Style Fighter

**His Understanding:**
> "You never confront the enemy one-on-one in a flat land. Just don't do it."

**What He Believed:**
- **Suddenly pounce** on enemy
- Or use surprise tactics
- **Never comfortable** with flat land engagement
- Both armies engaged until battle ends
- Not used to that fighting style

**His Preference:**
- **Cavalry man**
- Didn't believe in heavy artillery
- Wanted old-style fighting

---

## The Relevance Problem

### Why His Style Didn't Work

**The Geography:**
- Northern plains of India
- **All flat land**
- Between Ganga and Yamuna = **Doab**
- Called "the hour" (between two rivers)

**The Doab Characteristics:**
- **Extremely flat land**
- Best agricultural land you can find
- Plenty of water (sweet water)
- Flat land
- **Extremely good quality soil**

**The Strategic Problem:**
- **No hills**
- **No forts** (or only regular forts, not mountain forts like Shivaji had)
- Those forts easily conquered
- Not mountain forts
- Can't use Shivaji's tactics

**The Conclusion:**
> "The style of fighting he was used to or he wanted to fight it had little relevance in the northern plains of India."

## The River Crossing (Late December 1759)

### Why It's Possible Now

**December = More Feasible:**
- Winter month
- River levels lower
- If tried in **monsoon** = extremely difficult

**The Memory:**
- Same river where Dattaji needed Najib's help
- Just a few months ago (no, that was Ganga)
- Wait, different river - this is Yamuna
- But same principle applies

**The Crossing:**
- December conditions favorable
- Probably crossed at **low lying land**
- Different areas where can cross easily
- Month of December made it possible

---

## Holkar's Belated Response

### Getting the Message

**December 27, 1759:**
- Holkar got **Dattaji's message**
- Calling for help
- Began preparations to join Shinde

**The Problem:**
- **Already too late**
- Was **375 kilometers away**

### Finally Leaving Jaipur

**January 2, 1760:**
- Holkar finally left Jaipur
- Moved towards Delhi
- To join Dattaji

**The Assessment:**
> "Perhaps he did not sense the urgency of Dattaji's situation."

**But:**
> "Ahmad Shah Abdali did."

---

## The Race Against Time

### Abdali's Awareness

**What He Knew:**
- Holkar now coming
- Timing was **perfect**
- Needs to destroy Dattaji **before Malhar Rao's army shows up**

**The Implication:**
- Window of opportunity
- Dattaji isolated
- Holkar still days away
- Must strike now

## Critical Insights

### The Climate as Weapon

**Winter's Impact:**
- Marathas: Flimsy clothes, suffering in cold
- Afghans: Prepared, used to colder weather
- Fog: Reduced visibility, tactical disadvantage
- **Not conducive for Marathas**

**Why It Matters:**
- Physical discomfort = reduced effectiveness
- Can't see well in fog
- Morale impact
- Natural advantage to Afghans
- Timing of invasion deliberate

### The Technology vs. Tradition Debate

**Holkar's Problem:**
- Trained under Bajirao I
- Believes in old tactics:
  - Light and fast
  - Cavalry-based
  - Surprise attacks
  - Never one-on-one in flat land

**The Reality:**
- Northern plains = all flat land
- No hills, no mountain forts
- Old tactics have **little relevance**
- Need heavy artillery
- But Holkar doesn't believe in it

**The Generation Gap:**
- Holkar represents old guard
- 50+ years old
- Set in his ways
- Can't adapt to new warfare

### The Questionable Character

**Evidence Against Holkar:**
1. **Soft corner for Najib Khan** - potential conflict of interest
2. **Wasted time** in Rajasthan collecting tributes
3. **Didn't sense urgency** of Dattaji's situation
4. **Old-fashioned tactics** inappropriate for terrain
5. **Underestimated Abdali** - thought he was overrated
6. **"Let down the Marathas"** in the actual battle (foreshadowed)

**The Implication:**
- Not fully committed
- Personal interests > collective goal
- Will be a problem in coming battle

### The Conspiracy Theory

**Madho Singh's Role:**
- **Secret conjunction** with Najib Khan
- Deliberately **detained Holkar**
- Offered stiff resistance to Barwada siege
- Kept Holkar busy in Rajasthan

**Why:**
- In cahoots with Abdali
- Part of Abdali's political warfare
- But no one knew it at the time
- Worked perfectly

### The River Defense Strategy

**The Logic:**
- Yamuna = natural barrier
- Catch Abdali while crossing = most vulnerable
- Can destroy army then
- Both Sabaji and Dattaji positioned for this

**The Problem:**
- It's a **guessing game**
- Abdali already crossed
- Now joining Najib
- Strategy didn't work
- Abdali outmaneuvered them

### The Timing Perfection

**Abdali's Awareness:**
- Knows Holkar is coming
- Knows Holkar is 375km away
- At least week to 10 days travel
- **Window of opportunity**
- Must strike before Holkar arrives

**The Math:**
- Dattaji: 25,000 troops
- Abdali + Najib: 60,000+ troops
- Ratio: 2.5:1 or worse
- Holkar: Still days away
- Perfect time to attack

### The Ideological Divide

**Bajirao I's Legacy:**
- Taught: Never fight one-on-one in flat land
- Light and fast tactics
- Guerrilla warfare
- Cavalry supremacy

**The New Reality:**
- Must fight in flat land
- No choice
- Heavy artillery essential
- Old tactics don't work

**The Conflict:**
- Old guard (Holkar) vs. new needs
- Can't adapt in time
- Stuck in outdated ideology
- Will cost them dearly

---

## What's Coming

**The Setup:**
- Abdali + Najib combined = massive force
- Dattaji isolated with 25,000
- Holkar finally coming but still ~10 days away
- Winter conditions favoring Afghans
- Dattaji positioned at river crossings
- But Abdali already crossed
- Perfect storm

**The Race:**
- Can Dattaji survive until Holkar arrives?
- Will Abdali strike before reinforcements?
- Will Holkar even fight properly when he gets there?
- Is Holkar secretly sympathetic to Najib?

**The Foreshadowing:**
- "We're just getting warmed up"
- "The actual battle is far away"
- "Something may be happening here"
- Holkar will "let down the Marathas"
- His underestimation of Abdali will matter

---

**Late December 1759 - Early January 1760: The pieces are in position. Dattaji shivers in his flimsy Deccan clothes while thick fog rolls across the flat lands. Holkar, 375 kilometers away, finally leaves Jaipur - a week too late - still believing Abdali is overrated. Meanwhile, Abdali knows exactly what he's doing. He's joined Najib. He's got the numbers. He's got the weather. He's got the timing. And he knows Holkar is coming. But he also knows he's got about ten days to destroy Dattaji first. The window is open. The trap is set. And nobody in the Maratha camp understands just how perfectly Abdali has orchestrated all of this. The politics have been won. The geography favors him. The climate favors him. The timing favors him. All that's left is the violence.**
