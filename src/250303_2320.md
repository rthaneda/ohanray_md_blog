**Where This Leads:** Kashi Ram Shivadev is the closest thing we have to an impartial observer of the Third Battle of Panipat. Bilingual, educated, with access to all three camps, he provides documentary evidence of forces, weapons, organization, and strategy. His memoir written 19 years after allows reflection without immediate fear. He bridges Marathi and Farsi worlds, understands both mentalities, and can judge both sides fairly. In a war of propaganda and selective histories, his voice—despite being unknown to many—provides crucial balance.

---

*He was sixty years old and had been watching empires rise and fall for twenty-six years. He spoke both languages. He moved between all three camps. He translated the words that meant life or death. When the battle came, he was there. And when it was over, he wrote down what he'd seen. Not for glory. Not for revenge. Just for the record. For history. For the truth.*
