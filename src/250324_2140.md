# The December 7 Skirmish: Tactical Victory, Psychological Defeat (December 7, 1760)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Context: Desperate Measures and Supply Lines

### The Food Crisis

**The Reality:**
- Maratha population: 100,000+ people
- Plus massive animal herds
- Must be fed daily
- Supply lines compressed/under stress
- Getting painful

**The Cash Problem:**
- No money coming from Delhi (Marathas controlled it but Abdali blocked it)
- On cash-only basis for supplies
- Suppliers won't give credit (don't know who will win)
- In stressed condition: no credit available
- Must pay hard money immediately

### The Creative Solution

**The Melting Down:**
- Whatever gold/silver available
- Whatever ornaments/utensils they had
- Melted down all precious metals
- Minted new coins
- Called: "Bhau Shahi," "Malhar Shahi," "Janko Shahi"
- Named after the three main force commanders
- These became currency

**The Effectiveness:**
- Solved supply problem for weeks/days
- Could get supplies with new coins
- Temporary measure
- Eventually ran out of meltable materials

### Bundele's Continued Failure

**The Frustration:**
- Bhau "irate" with Govind Pant Bundele
- Couldn't destroy Afghan supply lines
- Wasn't cutting supplies coming from Doab/Rohilkhand
- Bhau expected him to do exactly what Abdali was doing
- Tables turned on Maratha

**The Reality:**
- Bundele not effective
- Older (approaching 60)
- Not a fighter to begin with
- Tax collector/administrator background
- Bhau expecting too much

---

## The Doab Operations: Finally Getting Somewhere

### The Geopolitics

**What Is Doab:**
- Land between Yamuna and Ganga rivers
- Technically the definition
- Suja Uddaula's kingdom located there
- Fertile farmland
- Lots of granaries

### The Breakthrough

**The Success:**
- Finally: 4,30,000 rupees collected
- Handed to Naro Shankar (Maratha commander in Delhi)
- Could be sent to Bhau's camp
- Got into Doab area
- Started collecting grains

**The Free Reign:**
- Bundele had 6,000-7,000 soldiers
- Freely moving around Doab
- Nobody could stop him
- All forces concentrated at Panipat
- Shuja's forces tied up with Abdali

### The Chokepoint: Mirath

**The Strategic Location:**
- Mirath: town in Doab area
- Where most supplies transported from
- To Abdali's camp
- Bundele now understood had to choke it
- Started attacking that area

**The Result:**
- Supply lines choked up
- Inflationary cycle started in Abdali camp
- Supply disruption working finally
- Afghan camp feeling it
- Allies starting to worry

### The Coalition Panic

**The Effect:**
- Allies (Suja Uddaula, others) starting to worry
- Bundele destroying fields/houses in Doab
- Local people panicking
- Allied commanders thinking: "What about my home?"
- Less likely to want to fight

---

## The Communication Crisis

### The Messengers Problem

**The Difficulty:**
- Distance Panipat to Pune: 1,500+ kilometers
- Goes through Abdali's area
- Afghans could intercept messengers
- Can't travel main routes (attacked)
- Must use byways/lesser-known paths

**The Result:**
- Peshwa not getting news from Panipat
- Maybe one or two letters reaching him
- Very rare
- Communication nearly cut off
- Peshwa operating in information vacuum

---

## The December 7 Skirmish: Bhau's Wooden Challenge

### The Setup

**The Challenge:**
- Marathas cleared jungle around Chhazpur
- Erected wooden column/pole
- National flag raised
- Fire lit for Abdali
- Literal invitation to battle

**The Meaning:**

- "Come and fight with us"
- At this specific location
- Come and take on the Marathas

### The Afghan Response

- Forces engaged in serious skirmish

**Bhau's Orders:**

### Holkar's Crisis

**The Attack:**

- Holkar's men began retreating/running
- Army breaking apart
- Crisis moment

**Holkar's Response:**
- Sat on ground on a mat
- Told men: "Run away, save your lives"

- "Let them cut my head and take it away"
- Dramatic sacrifice gesture

**The Recovery:**

## The Aftermath: Sati and Morale Collapse

### The Tradition: Sati (Immolation)

**The Practice:**
- Widow immolates on husband's pyre
- Not compulsory but elected tradition
- Women considered it their duty
- Some wouldn't be convinced otherwise
- Ritual suicide/self-immolation

**The Historical Precedent:**
- Shivaji opposed this practice
- When his stepmother wanted to do it
- He convinced her not to
- Called her to refuse
- She agreed to his persuasion
- Shivaji was reformer on this issue

### Lakshmi Bhai's Choice

**The Situation:**
- Barwant Rao's wife: Lakshmi Bhai
- Young son left behind: Appa Barwant
- Wife decided to immolate herself

**Bhau's Plea:**
- Tried to change her mind
- Knew it would lower morale
- Knew it would demoralize camp
- Tradition was elective, not compulsory
- Begged her to reconsider

**Her Refusal:**
- Didn't listen to Bhau
- Entrusted son to Bhau
- "You take care of him, I will die"
- "I will immolate myself"
- Refused all persuasion

### The Psychological Impact

**The News:**
- Spread throughout camp
- "Not something that brings spirits up"
- Demoralizes entire Maratha camp
- Young son left orphan
- Wife publicly choosing death

**The Legacy:**
- Appa Barwant Chowk named after her son (or possibly father)
- Barwant Rao Mehendri's name remembered
- Wife's choice became part of legend
- Tactical victory overshadowed
- Psychological blow irreversible

- Experienced personality
- Seen many battles
- Didn't align with Bhau
- Opposed frontal warfare strategy
- Preferred surgical strikes
- Saw Abdali's fury, was concerned
- Worried "not up to it"

**The Difference:**

- Shinde: "Okay but no Dattaji," younger but serviceable

- Abhau relied most on Mehendri

### The Loss

**Where This Leads:** December 7, 1760, the Marathas win a clear tactical victory. They inflict 1,500 casualties on the Afghans while losing 150 of their own. But it's meaningless. Barwant Rao Mehendri—Bhau's closest advisor, his strategic partner, the one who believed in his vision—is killed. And then his widow, refusing all persuasion, immolates herself in front of the entire camp. The news spreads. Morale shatters. A military victory becomes a psychological defeat. The news of Mehendri's death and his wife's sati ripples through the Maratha camp like a shock wave. Meanwhile, Bundele finally gets supplies from Delhi and finally starts choking Abdali's supply lines from Mirath. But it's too late. The Marathas just lost their most important commander and their most important ally—morale.

*December 7. The Marathas beat the Afghans in a fair fight. Inflicted more casualties. Held the ground. It should have been a victory. But Barwant Rao Mehendri took a bullet in the chest. When his men got him back, his body was already being scalped by Afghan soldiers. And his wife—Lakshmi Bhai—watched her husband brought back dead. She didn't grieve. She didn't retreat into the camp. She decided to immolate herself on his pyre. In front of everyone. In front of the entire army. And no matter what Bhau said, no matter how hard he pleaded with her, she wouldn't change her mind. She handed her young son to Bhau and walked into the flames. And the entire Maratha camp watched their best commander's wife choose death over life. The tactical victory meant nothing. The psychological defeat meant everything.*
