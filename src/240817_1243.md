**The Assassination:**
- **57-70 soldiers decided to attack** Nadir Shah's tent

- Only **2 soldiers went through:** Sahil Khan & Mohammad Khan
- Nadir Shah tried to fight with sword

## Abdali's Escape: The Kohinoor Capture

**The Morning After:**
- Early morning, Abdali reached Nadir Shah's tent
- Found the dead body
- Nadir's Iranian army busy looting treasury

**The Discovery:**
- Abdali alone in tent when he inspected Shah's clothes
- Found **Kohinoor diamond** in possessions
- Found **royal seals/stamps**
- These had been taken from India originally
- Now in Nadir Shah's hands = now in Abdali's hands

**The Escape:**
- Got out of Nadir's military encampment
- Took his **4,000 Afghan army** with him
- Left with the Kohinoor

**The Collapse:**
- Within a day: Nadir's treasury was gone
- Military camp in complete disorder
- Transformed from organization → chaos
- Abdali had basically dissolved the power structure

---

## Abdali's Age & Experience

**His Status:**
- Only **25 years old** at this moment
- But had been in Nadir Shah's army for **10 years**
- Battle-hardened, experienced commander
- Expert knowledge in warfare

---

## Afghanistan's Political Situation

**The Context:**
- Afghanistan **NOT independent** at this time
- Divided between Persian & Mughal control:
  - **Kabul:** Under Mughal control
  - **Kandahar:** Under Persian control
  - Both cities shared; no separate Afghan identity

**The Reality:**
- Afghanistan was essentially vassal territories
- No separate "Afghanistan" as nation
- Part of larger Persian/Mughal sphere
- Extremely poor, underdeveloped region

**The Opportunity:**
- With Nadir Shah dead and Persia destabilized
- Afghanistan could potentially unify
- Abdali saw the opportunity
- Had military experience to lead

---

## The Ambition: Building an Afghan Kingdom

**Abdali's Plan:**
- Return to Afghanistan (his home)
- Establish own independent kingdom
- Unify the fragmented territories

**The Financial Need:**
- Afghanistan is extremely poor (wasteland)
- "Nothing developed there, zero resources"
- Can't build kingdom without money
- Knew exactly where to get it: **India**
- Observed Nadir's looting: understood the model

---

## The Loya Jirga: Afghan Tribal Assembly

**The Problem:**
- Afghanistan divided into **many tribes**
- Each tribe had own headman/leader
- Tribes fought each other constantly
- No unified leadership

**The Solution:**
- **Loya Jirga** = Assembly of tribal chiefs
- Idea: Select one unified leader
- End tribal fighting, create united front
- Common goal: Build independent Afghan kingdom

**The Process:**
- Assembly convened with all tribal leaders
- Discussion lasted **9 days**
- Every tribe wanted their headman to be chief
- **No consensus could be reached**
- All competing for leadership

---

## The Election: Divine Intervention

**The Breakthrough:**
- One tribal leader stood up on day 9
- Made a speech pointing to Ahmad Shah Abdali
- Said (approximately):
  > "Allah has sent Ahmad Khan who is superior to all of you"
  > "Why are you making these pointless discussions?"

**The Instant Resolution:**
- All assembled leaders showed approval
- **Ahmad Shah Abdali elected unanimously**
- Became unified leader of all tribes
- Based on military credentials, not tribal politics

**Why He Was Chosen:**
- Military experience (10 years under Nadir)
- Young but battle-hardened
- Had already escaped with 4,000 troops
- Had proven leadership ability
- Not tied to any single tribe (could be neutral)

---

## The Predictions: Multiple Prophecies

**Nizam ul Mulk's Prediction (1739):**
- During Nadir Shah's 1739 Delhi invasion
- Nizam ul Mulk (same guy defeated by Bajirao I) in Delhi
- Saw Ahmad Shah Abdali among Nadir's commanders
- Said: "This young man has royal aura"
- Predicted he would become great leader

**Why Nizam Could Tell:**
- Had ability to "read faces" (Mukhasamudrik)
- Could sense leadership qualities from appearance
- Told Nadir Shah about Abdali's potential

**Nadir Shah's Reaction:**
- Trusted Nizam ul Mulk's judgment
- Believed in his forecasting abilities
- Cut Abdali's ear lobes with dagger
- Said: "When you become emperor, you'll think of me"
- (Note: Some sources say nostrils, others say ear lobes - unclear which)

**Three Days Before Assassination:**
- Someone else told Abdali same thing
- "You are destined to be emperor"
- Another prophecy fulfilled
- Multiple people seeing his destiny

---

## Nizam ul Mulk's Background

**Who He Was:**
- Same Nizam defeated by Bajirao I at **Palkhed**
- Had cannons = heavy, slow, strategic liability
- Bajirao forced him to abandon cannons
- Surrounded him, cut off water & food
- Made him sign humiliating treaty

**His Later Career:**
- Returned to Delhi after Palkhed defeat
- Became important courtier in Delhi court
- Witnessed Nadir Shah's 1739 looting
- Saw destruction and waste
- Understood Mughal weakness

**His Assessment:**
- Realized Mughal court was "paper tiger"
- Eventually established own kingdom in Hyderabad
- Said he'd be loyal to Mughals BUT independent
- Foreshadowing broader pattern of Mughal collapse

## Critical Insights

### 1. The Opportune Moment
Nadir's assassination created power vacuum. Abdali was right place, right time, with right experience. Seized opportunity instantly.

### 2. Tribal Unification
Nine days of impasse → one speech → unanimous election. Abdali's military credentials + neutrality solved tribal problem.

### 3. The Prophecies as Foreshadowing
Multiple people predicting Abdali's rise suggests genuine charisma/capability recognition. Not just luck but recognized talent.

### 4. The Kohinoor Symbol
Abdali capturing Kohinoor = symbolic capture of India's wealth. Not just military symbol but economic statement.

### 5. The Geographic Advantage
Afghanistan suddenly independent with unified leader, 4,000 troops, and Kohinoor. Ready to pursue Nadir's model: raid India for wealth.

## The Connection to Marathas

**What Comes Next:**
- Abdali will use Afghanistan as base
- Will invade India repeatedly
- Will clash with Marathas over control of subcontinent
- Will eventually meet Marathas at Panipat (1761)
- Nizam ul Mulk's prediction = Abdali becomes major threat

---

**Where We Left Off:** Ahmad Shah Abdali has unified Afghanistan, captured the Kohinoor, and established himself as independent ruler at age 25. With 4,000 troops and the knowledge of India's wealth (from observing Nadir), he's ready to execute his own invasion plan. Marathas don't know it yet, but their next major enemy has just been born from the ashes of Nadir Shah's paranoia.

---

*Nadir Shah came to loot India and did. But his paranoia created enemies who killed him. Abdali watched it all: the looting method, the wealth location, the power collapse. When Nadir died, Abdali escaped with 4,000 troops and the Kohinoor diamond. Nine days later, he's elected by tribal assembly to lead unified Afghanistan. At 25, with military experience and a master plan (raid India periodically like Nadir did), he's ready to start building his empire. Marathas are at their peak. They don't know what's coming. A young Afghan is about to change everything.*
