## Peshwa's Letters to Dattaji Shinde

### Letter to Ramaji Anant (17 December 1758)

**Who Was Ramaji Anant:**
- Shinde family's **Amatya** (Chief of Staff)
- Administrative head handling Shinde clan affairs
- Recipient of official instructions from Peshwa

**The Core Instructions:**

> "Take the side of the Wazir and destroy Najeeb Khan Rohila"

**Why This Mattered:**
- Nana Saheb Peshwa KNEW Najeeb Khan was a troublemaker
- "He is never going to come around" - irredeemable enemy
- Needs to be eliminated, not negotiated with
- More like an extremist - no room for compromise

**The Missed Opportunity:**
- When Nana Saheb was in Delhi previously, he could have dealt with Najeeb
- But **Malhar Rao Holkar interfered** - protected Najeeb
- So Najeeb survived and remained a problem
- Now giving Dattaji clear orders: finish the job

---

### The Punjab Leadership Vacuum

**The Adina Beg Problem:**

*The Setup:*
- **Lahore and Punjab** had been secured (briefly)
- **Adina Beg** appointed as new Subedar of Punjab by Raghunath Rao
- Was supposed to handle administration and defense
- **Sabaji Shinde** stationed to help Adina Beg
  - Sabaji = younger brother (or close relative) of Dattaji Shinde

*The Crisis:*
- **Adina Beg DIED**
- Left Punjab without a Subedar (governor)
- Sabaji Shinde was an outsider with insufficient forces
- No legitimate local authority figure
- Power vacuum creating instability

**Peshwa's Response:**
- This is why Dattaji Shinde MUST go to Punjab
- Must provide strong leadership presence
- Establish new administrative structure
- Can't leave Sabaji alone with inadequate resources

---

## The Bengal Directive

### Why Bengal Matters

**Nana Saheb's Calculation:**
> "The work to be done in Bengal is also important. In Bengal, we can make money."

**The Strategy:**
- Head east towards Bengal after securing Punjab
- Bengal = revenue source desperately needed
- This is the solution to Peshwa's debt crisis

### The Shuja-ud-Daula Factor

**Who Was Shuja-ud-Daula:**
- Subedar of **Awadh** (also called Ayodhya)
- The "kingdom of Ayodhya" (later called Awadh by Muslims)
- His territory lay between Delhi and Bengal
- Key ally for eastern expansion

**The Plan:**
- When moving east toward Bengal, take the Wazir with you
- Having the Mughal Wazir along provides legitimacy
- If you need help, the Wazir's presence helps negotiations
- Adds official Mughal sanction to the campaign

---

## The Trust Factor

### Peshwa's Confidence in Dattaji

> "If Dattaji Shinde really focuses on something, he will definitely do it."

**Why Such Confidence:**
- Nana Saheb had complete faith in Dattaji's abilities
- Track record of completing assigned tasks
- Honest and reliable
- Focused and determined

**The Warning About Trust:**
> "There's no need to take help from people whom we cannot trust."

**The Mansoor Ali Mystery:**
- Someone named "Mansoor Ali" mentioned in the letter
- Identity unclear - possibly unreliable ally
- Definitely NOT the same person as Shuja-ud-Daula
- Peshwa warning against involving untrustworthy characters

---

## The Desperate Financial Plea

### Peshwa's Personal Request

**The Summary of the Letter:**
> "Please do me a favor because I'm in debt. I need to pay it off, at least partially. Make sure you make some money for me."

**The Backstory:**
- Raghunath Rao went north with borrowed money
- Peshwa gave him treasure acquired through loans
- Raghunath Rao **came back with INCREASED debt**
- Peshwa now desperate for revenue

**The Order:**
> "Do whatever it takes, but get me some money."

**The Pressure:**
- This wasn't just a military mission
- This was a financial rescue operation
- Dattaji HAD to return with tribute/revenue
- The Peshwa's government was on the edge of bankruptcy

---

## The Second Letter (24 December 1758)

### A Comprehensive Strategic Document

**To:** Dattaji Shinde directly

**Length:** Several pages long - very detailed

**Content:**
- Reinforced points from the first letter
- Provided detailed ideas and directions
- Outlined different scenarios Dattaji might face
- Gave **three alternatives** for various situations
- Comprehensive strategic guidance

**Purpose:**
- Ensure Dattaji understood the mission completely
- Prepare him for multiple contingencies
- Show the complexity and importance of the task
- Demonstrate how much thought Peshwa had put into this

---

## Jankoji Shinde's Rajasthan Mission

### The Kota Succession Crisis (Late 1758)

**Jankoji Shinde:**
- Another member of Shinde clan
- Son of **Jayappa Shinde** (Dattaji's elder brother who died)
- Young commander, around 20-22 years old

**The Mission:**
- Went to Rajasthan
- Small kingdom called **Kota** (like Jaipur or Jodhpur)
- The king had died
- **Succession battle** between two or more sons

**The Resolution:**
- Jankoji successfully mediated/resolved the dispute
- Got tribute payment for this service
- This money would help Nana Saheb
- Successful completion of mission

---

## The Generational Meeting: Jankoji & Malhar Rao

### Age and Experience Gap

**At the Meeting:**
- **Jankoji:** 20-22 years old, young and fresh
- **Malhar Rao Holkar:** 50-55 years old, seasoned veteran

**Experience Difference:**
- Malhar Rao had operated in North India for decades
- Had "fixed opinions" about northern politics
- Set in his ways - "old hag" mentality
- Years of experience hardened his views

**Jankoji's Perspective:**
- Just forming his opinions
- Open-minded to new ideas
- Hadn't developed rigid views yet
- More flexible in thinking

---

## The Shinde-Holkar Rivalry Softens

### Traditional Rivalry

**Background:**
- Shinde and Holkar families were traditional rivals
- Competing for influence and resources
- Tension between the two clans

**The Breakthrough:**
- This meeting between Jankoji and Malhar Rao
- Helped reduce the intensity of rivalry
- Personal connection helped bridge clan divide
- Not complete resolution, but significant improvement

---

## Malhar Rao's Controversial Advice

### The Najeeb Khan Strategy

**Jankoji's Question:**
- Asked Malhar Rao about politics of the North
- Seeking advice from experienced commander

**Malhar Rao's Response:**
> "Don't get entangled with Najeeb Khan."

### The Logic Behind the Advice

**Surface Reasoning:**

*The Argument:*
- In Peshwa's eyes, Najeeb Khan Rohila is a big obstacle
- If you kill Najeeb Khan, problem is solved
- But then: Why does Peshwa need you anymore?
- With Najeeb gone, northern situation improves dramatically
- You become obsolete, no longer valuable

**The Self-Preservation Strategy:**
> "Let Najeeb Khan stay in the picture. By doing that, you're doing yourself a favor."

*The Calculation:*
- As long as Najeeb exists, you're needed to deal with him
- Peshwa will keep you around, value your presence
- You remain "precious" to Peshwa
- Maintain job security by maintaining the problem

**The Warning:**
> "If you don't let go of Najeeb Khan, the Peshwa will punish you? NO. If you DO kill Najeeb Khan, you make yourself obsolete."

### The Hidden Agenda

**The Real Reason:**
- Malhar Rao had adopted Najeeb Khan as his "son"
- Special father-son relationship
- Personal bond, not just political calculation

**The Concealment:**
- Malhar Rao tried to hide this real motivation
- Framed it as career advice for Jankoji
- "You'll be of use to Peshwa because he needs someone to handle Najeeb"
- But actually protecting his adopted son

**The Manipulation:**
- Telling Jankoji to spare Najeeb
- Claiming it's for Jankoji's benefit
- Really protecting his own relationship
- Classic case of self-interest disguised as mentorship

---

## The Complex Triangle

### Three-Way Dynamic

**Peshwa's Position:**
- Wants Najeeb Khan eliminated
- Sees him as irredeemable troublemaker
- Direct orders to destroy him

**Malhar Rao's Position:**
- Wants Najeeb Khan protected
- Personal relationship (adopted son)
- Career justification as cover
- Actively working against Peshwa's wishes

**Jankoji/Dattaji's Position:**
- Caught between contradictory guidance
- Peshwa says kill Najeeb
- Senior respected commander says spare him
- Must make final decision

---

## The Authority Structure

### Shinde Clan Hierarchy

**Decision-Making:**
- **Dattaji Shinde** = Head of Shinde clan (after Jayappa's death)
- All major decisions go through him
- Jankoji is youngest member of the clan
- Even if Jankoji has ideas, must get Dattaji's approval

**Previous Leaders:**
- **Jayappa Shinde** - former head, now deceased
- Killed by Vijay Singh (avenged by Dattaji in Marwad)

**Parallel Structure:**
- **Holkar clan** headed by **Malhar Rao Holkar** (also called "Malharba")
- Each clan operates somewhat independently
- But both serve under Peshwa ultimately

---

## Raghunath Rao's Regret

### The 1758 Delhi Opportunity

**What Happened:**
- Raghunath Rao took Delhi in 1758
- Had opportunity to remove Najeeb Khan
- **Failed to do so** - mainly because Malhar Rao adopted Najeeb as son
- Protected him from elimination

**The Regret:**
- Raghunath Rao now repents this decision
- Wishes he had dealt with Najeeb when he had the chance
- But it's in the past, nothing can be done
- Najeeb survives to cause more problems

**The Pattern:**
- Malhar Rao consistently protecting Najeeb
- Blocking efforts to eliminate him
- Creating ongoing problems for Maratha strategy
- Personal relationships interfering with strategic objectives

## Major Themes

### 1. Conflicting Loyalties
Malhar Rao's personal loyalty to Najeeb Khan vs. his duty to Peshwa creates confusion in strategy.

### 2. Financial Desperation
Every strategic decision driven by Peshwa's crushing debt. "Get me money" is the primary objective.

### 3. Generational Divide
Young Jankoji (open-minded) vs. old Malhar Rao (fixed opinions) represents changing of the guard.

### 4. Hidden Agendas
Malhar Rao frames personal protection of Najeeb as career advice, disguising true motives.

### 5. Trust and Reliability
Peshwa's complete confidence in Dattaji contrasts with warning against unreliable allies.

---

## Strategic Objectives Summary

**For Dattaji Shinde:**

1. **Punjab**: Establish strong leadership, fill Adina Beg's vacuum
2. **Najeeb Khan**: Destroy him (despite Malhar Rao's advice to spare)
3. **Bengal**: Move east, generate revenue desperately needed
4. **Allies**: Use Wazir and Shuja-ud-Daula, avoid unreliable people
5. **Finance**: Above all - MAKE MONEY for the Peshwa

---

## The Contradiction

**Peshwa's Orders:**
- Kill Najeeb Khan
- He's irredeemable troublemaker
- Complete the job we failed to do in 1758

**Malhar Rao's Advice:**
- Don't kill Najeeb Khan
- Keep him alive for job security
- You'll be obsolete if problem is solved

**Dattaji's Dilemma:**
- Must obey Peshwa (ultimate authority)
- But respects Malhar Rao (senior commander)
- Personal relationships vs. strategic necessities
- Which guidance to follow?

---

## What's Coming

**Immediate Challenges:**
- Dattaji must balance contradictory advice
- Punjab needs immediate attention
- Najeeb Khan decision looming
- Eastern campaign toward Bengal must be planned
- Financial pressure mounting

**Underlying Tensions:**
- Shinde-Holkar rivalry (though improved)
- Malhar Rao's protection of Najeeb
- Peshwa's desperate financial situation
- Young commanders vs. old guard
- Personal loyalties vs. strategic objectives

---

*The letters reveal the complexity of Maratha politics - a Peshwa desperate for money, a trusted commander given impossible tasks, a senior leader protecting his adopted enemy son, and a young commander caught between conflicting advice. Everyone has their own agenda, and somehow Dattaji must navigate all of this while saving the empire from bankruptcy.*
