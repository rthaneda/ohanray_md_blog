# Malhar Rao's Cynical Advice & Dattaji's Punjab Operations (Late 1758-1759)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Malhar Rao's Infamous Warning

### The "Soldier of God" Chapter

**Chapter Title:** *Dattaji Shinde - Soldier of God*

### The Blunt Statement

**Malhar Rao Holkar explained to Jankoji:**

> "We chiefs will be no use for the Peshwa, and the Brahmin chief of the empire will make us wash his soiled clothes."

**Translation:**
- If we eliminate all problems (like Najeeb Khan)
- We become useless to the Peshwa
- We'll be reduced to menial servants
- "Washing soiled clothes" = degrading, lowly position
- Our military value disappears

**The Cynical Logic:**
- Najeeb Khan is the REASON Peshwa needs us
- Remove him = remove our purpose
- Keep the problem alive = keep our jobs secure
- Controlled opposition strategy

**The Question:**
> "Did you understand, Lurwe?"
- Direct question to Jankoji - making sure the message landed
- "Lurwe" might be affectionate term or nickname

---

## Jankoji's Response - Unclear

### Did He Buy It?

**The Text Says:**
> "Whether Jankoji was influenced by this remark and advice, one cannot say."

**The Shinde Family Dynamic:**
- Jankoji is the youngest member of the Shinde clan
- He's not the decision-maker
- **Dattaji Shinde** is the head of the family/clan
- All major decisions taken by Dattaji
- Jankoji might have opinions, but needs approval from head

**So Even If Influenced:**
- Jankoji couldn't act independently
- Would have to convince Dattaji
- Ultimate call rests with the clan head

---

## Raghunath Rao's Counter-Order

### Direct Command to Jankoji

**Meanwhile, Raghunath Rao:**
- Writing to Jankoji while returning from the north
- Clear instructions: **Take post at Delhi**
- Mission: **"Extirpate Najeeb Khan"** (destroy completely)
- Description: "The only thorn for the Marathas in the north"

**The Contrast:**
- Malhar Rao: "Keep Najeeb alive for job security"
- Raghunath Rao: "Eliminate Najeeb completely"
- Jankoji receiving contradictory orders
- One protects the problem, one solves it

---

## The Shinde Clan Structure

### Leadership Hierarchy

**Current Head:**
- **Dattaji Shinde** ("Dattaba" - affectionate nickname)
- Makes all major clan decisions
- Succeeded his elder brother Jayappa

**Previous Head:**
- **Jayappa Shinde** 
- Died/was killed (by Vijay Singh in Marwad)
- Dattaji avenged his death

**The Holkar Parallel:**
- **Malhar Rao Holkar** heads the Holkar clan
- Also called "Malharba" (affectionate nickname)
- Same structure as Shinde clan

**The System:**
- Each clan operates somewhat independently
- But all ultimately serve under Peshwa
- Clan leaders make strategic decisions for their people

---

## Raghunath Rao's 1758 Regret

### The Missed Opportunity

**What Happened in 1758:**
- Raghunath Rao **took Delhi**
- Had perfect opportunity to remove Najeeb Khan
- **FAILED to do so**
- Main reason: **Malhar Rao's adoption of Najeeb as his son**

**Current Feelings:**
> "Raghunath Rao regretted that he could not remove the nuisance of Najeeb Khan... mainly due to Malhar Rao's adoption of Najeeb as his son."

**The Pattern:**
- This is becoming a recurring problem
- Malhar Rao keeps blocking elimination of Najeeb
- Personal relationship interfering with strategy
- Raghunath Rao now wishes he'd acted anyway

---

## Malhar Rao's Secret Motivation Revealed

### The Real Reason for the Advice

**We Now See:**
> "But now we also see he has the secret kind of reason that we are no use to the Peshwa without Najeeb. So he keeps him as controlled opposition kind of."

**The Two-Layer Strategy:**

*Layer 1 (Public Justification):*
- "Keep Najeeb alive for your career"
- Framed as mentorship advice to younger commanders
- Job security argument

*Layer 2 (Hidden Personal Motive):*
- Protecting his adopted son
- Personal father-son bond with Najeeb
- Emotional attachment driving strategic advice

**The Manipulation:**
- Disguising personal protection as professional advice
- Making others complicit in keeping Najeeb alive
- Creating strategic justification for emotional decision

---

## The Peshwa's Mounting Debt

### The Inherited Problem

**Sources of Debt:**

1. **Inherited from Bajirao I** (his father)
   - Much of the debt pre-existed Nana Saheb
   - Starting from a hole financially

2. **Northern Expeditions**
   - Consistently giving **diminishing returns**
   - Costs outpacing revenues

3. **Abdali's Raids**
   - Left northern territories **"barren of wealth"**
   - The richest areas had been looted already
   - Nothing left to extract

**The Comparison:**
> "The Peshwa's debt was mounting. Much of this was inherited from his father, Bajirao. Dattaji's expedition was to help reduce this mountain of debt that Nana Saheb Peshwa called **'consumption'**."

**Consumption = Tuberculosis:**
- A disease that eats away at the body
- Slowly destroys from within
- Eventually fatal if untreated
- Perfect metaphor for the debt crisis

---

## Bihar and Bengal: The Last Hope

### Why These Provinces Matter

**The Calculation:**
> "The Peshwa knew that Bihar and Bengal were the best hope of retiring his debt."

**Why They're Different:**
- **Abdali had NOT raided these provinces**
- Still wealthy and prosperous
- Functioning economies
- Good tax bases
- Agricultural output intact

**Contrast with North:**
- Delhi and surrounding areas: looted by Abdali
- Punjab: constantly unstable, costly to maintain
- Rajasthan: Rajputs not paying promised tributes
- Only the east remained untapped

---

## The Sequential Strategy Before Bengal

### Dattaji's To-Do List

**Before invading Bengal, Dattaji needed to:**

1. **Ensure security of Punjab**
   - Can't leave exposed northern flank
   - Abdali threat remains

2. **Secure Najeeb Khan** (neutralize or eliminate)
   - Can't leave this enemy in rear
   - But Malhar Rao complicating this

3. **Take Doab**
   - Region between Ganga and Yamuna
   - Strategic central position
   - Rich agricultural land

4. **Go east through friendly Shuja-ud-Daula's Awadh**
   - Need safe passage
   - Can't fight on all fronts
   - Awadh cooperation essential

5. **Take Patna** (capital of Bihar)
   - Gateway to Bengal
   - Major city and strategic base

**The Complexity:**
- Each step depends on previous steps
- Can't skip ahead
- Linear progression required
- Any failure breaks the chain

---

## Late 1758: The Supremacy Moment

### Maratha Peak Power

**The Situation:**
> "In late 1758, the Marathas were supreme in the north, and it only needed an invasion of Bengal to secure the entire subcontinent."

**What This Meant:**
- Marathas had **maximum territorial control**
- Delhi under their influence
- Punjab nominally secured
- Only Bengal remained independent
- Complete subcontinent control within reach

### The Bengal Question

**Even with Raghuji Bhosle:**
- Raghuji Bhosle was collecting tributes from Bengal
- BUT there was **no direct control** over Bengal
- Raghuji was just taking money, not ruling
- Not the same as administrative control

**Peshwa's Position:**
> "Peshwa was saying, I don't give a damn about that previous accord that Shahu had negotiated with Raghuji Bhosle."

*The 1743 Agreement:*
- Shahu had mediated division of territories
- Bengal was Raghuji Bhosle's exclusive sphere
- Lasted peacefully for about 20 years

*Breaking the Agreement:*
- Nana Saheb now ready to violate this
- Desperate financial situation overriding old treaties
- "I will be looting here as I please"
- No other option but to look to Bengal

---

## The Impossible Task

### Why This Was So Difficult

**For Even the "Soldierly Dattaji":**
> "However, this was a tall task, which is the invasion of Bengal for even the soldierly Dattaji."

**The Challenges:**
1. Distance from home base
2. Multiple enemies in between
3. River crossings with full army
4. Supply line maintenance
5. Financial pressure for immediate results
6. Breaking treaty with fellow Marathas
7. Dealing with British presence in Bengal

---

## Jankoji's Early Success

### The Jaipur Tribute (Closing Days of 1758)

**The Mission:**
- Jankoji obtained **assurances of promised tribute** from Jaipur
- Madho Singh (Raja of Jaipur) agreed to pay
- This was important preliminary success

**Moving Towards Delhi:**
- Jankoji and Dattaji proceeded towards Delhi together
- End of 1758 / early 1759
- Preparing for major operations

---

## Malhar Rao's Illness and Return to Pune

### The Senior Commander Steps Back

**The Illness:**
- Malhar Rao recovering from "serious illness"
- Had to return to Pune for recovery
- Out of action in the north temporarily

**The Explanation:**
- Once in Pune, Malhar Rao tried to explain himself to Peshwa
- **"His acts of omission in the north"**
- Basically explaining why he missed opportunities
- Why he didn't do certain things (like eliminate Najeeb)
- Peshwa was "not very pleased with him"

---

## Back to Rajasthan

### The Tribute Collection Mission

**Peshwa's Orders to Malhar Rao:**
- Go back to Rajasthan
- Obtain **pending payment** from:
  1. **Maharana of Udaipur**
  2. **Madho Singh of Jaipur**

**The Problem:**
- These Rajput kingdoms had made agreements to pay yearly tributes
- They **consistently failed to meet** these payments
- Always making promises, never delivering
- Had to be "constantly watched over"

---

## Malhar Rao's Year-Long Siege (Entire Year of 1759)

### The Jaipur Stalemate

**What Happened:**
- Malhar Rao remained in Rajasthan for **entire year of 1759**
- Trying to extract payment from Madho Singh
- Madho Singh organized **strong defense**
- Jaipur protected by **strong compound walls** all around the city

**The Failure:**
> "Malhar Rao could not make much headway as long as Jaipur was protected by its strong walls."

**The Frustration:**
- Whole year spent laying siege
- Couldn't breach the walls
- Couldn't force payment
- Eventually loses patience
- No results to show

---

## Madho Singh's Betrayal Revealed

### The Secret Correspondence

**The Shocking Discovery:**
> "What Holkar did not know was that Madho Singh was corresponding with Abdali at this time and following his instructions to obstruct the Marathas at every opportunity."

**The Double Game:**

*On the Surface:*
- Madho Singh agreeing to pay tribute
- Negotiating with Marathas
- Appearing cooperative

*Behind the Scenes:*
- **In contact with Abdali**
- Following Abdali's orders
- Mission: Obstruct Marathas at every opportunity
- Part of coordinated anti-Maratha alliance

**Why This Worked:**
> "See all the powers in the north were tired of Marathas, you know, trying to pester them for money."

*The Northern Powers' Perspective:*
- Marathas constantly demanding tribute
- No way to counter them militarily (individually)
- Even collectively, couldn't defeat Marathas
- Only power capable of challenging them: **Abdali**
- So coordinate with Abdali against common enemy

---

## Dattaji and Jankoji at Delhi Gates

### The Timeline Split

**Geographical Positions:**
- **Malhar Rao:** In Pune, recovering from illness
- **Dattaji and Jankoji:** At the gates of Delhi

**The Vazir's Promise:**
- Mughal Vazir promised funds to Dattaji
- Trying to buy time/cooperation
- Negotiating payment amounts

---

## Burari Ghat Encampment (Early 1759)

### Strategic Position

**The Location:**
> "The Shinde army encamped at Burari Ghat on the Yamuna, a few miles north of Delhi."

**Why Here:**
- North of Delhi
- On the Yamuna River
- Strategic position for multiple operations
- Close to Rohilkhand (Najeeb's territory)

---

## Crossing the Yamuna

### Invading Najeeb Khan's Territory

**The Water Conditions:**
> "The water of the Yamuna was low."

**The Crossing:**
- Dattaji's troops crossed over
- Invaded the territory of **Najeeb Khan**
- Moving into **Rohilkhand** (Rohila territory)

**About Rohilkhand:**
- This is the Rohila's home territory
- **Rohilas:** Originally Afghan soldiers
- Came to India as "soldiers of fortune"
- Became immigrants, settled in this region

**Why They Stayed:**
> "They just stayed there because they were immigrants and they said, well, this looks like a great land. It has rivers, it has fertile land."

*Contrast with Afghanistan:*
- Afghanistan: dry, harsh, limited water
- Rohilkhand: fertile, rivers, good agriculture
- No reason to return to Afghanistan

**The Loyalty Problem:**
> "But they never forgot their real loyalty was with Afghans."

*The Double Identity:*
- Settled in India
- But emotionally/politically still Afghan
- "Acting as spies of Abdali"
- "Still loyal to their mastery" (Afghanistan)
- Anything to do with Afghanistan = their real loyalty

---

## The Delhi Area Wait (January 1759)

### Negotiating Indemnity

**The Entire Month:**
> "The entire month of January 1759 was spent in the environs of Delhi."

**The Reason:**
- Negotiating with the Vazir
- Coming to agreement on **amount of indemnity**
- How much would be paid to Marathas

**Only After Agreement:**
- Dattaji finally moved northwards to Punjab
- Couldn't leave until finances secured
- Money was always the priority

---

## The Punjab Mission

### Why Dattaji Had to Go West

**The Leadership Vacuum:**
> "And what was the business in Punjab? Because Mr. Adina Beg, the Subedar, had died."

**The Requirements:**
- Appoint new Subedar
- "Beef up Punjab" - strengthen defenses
- Put administrative structures in place

**The Constant Danger:**
> "Punjab was constantly in danger of being attacked by Afghan army."

**Why Afghans Wanted Punjab:**

*Geographic:*
- Bordering Afghanistan
- Direct access

*Economic:*
- Rich in agricultural outputs
- Fertile land
- Lots of rivers
- Good water supply

*The Contrast:*
> "None of that existed in Afghanistan."

**Afghan Claim:**
- Afghans said: "Punjab is ours"
- Viewed it as natural extension
- Historically had controlled it
- Wanted it back for resources

---

## Peshwa's Decision on Imad-ul-Mulk

### Changing the Vazir

**The Decision:**
> "The Peshwa had at this time decided to remove Imad-ul-Mulk from the Vazir's position."

**The Treatment Difference:**

*Malhar Rao's Approach:*
- More "hands off"
- Tolerant
- Passive
- Little "pacific" (peace-loving, non-confrontational)

*Dattaji's Approach:*
- "If he says something, he will do it"
- Expects others to follow through same way
- No tolerance for excuses
- Proved by his actions and words

**The New Dynamic:**
> "The Mughal court was now dealing with a brusque, impatient soldier who would brook no nonsense."

**Dattaji's Order:**
- **Ordered** Imad-ul-Mulk to accompany him
- "In the defense of the emperor's interests"
- Not a request - a command
- Imad had to comply

---

## The Punjab Governing Problem

### Why It Was So Difficult

**Geographic/Cultural Challenges:**

> "Far away from their home base and surrounded by a predominantly hostile Muslim population with a roving Sikh presence, Punjab was a difficult province to govern for the Marathas."

**The Triple Problem:**

1. **Distance:** Far from Maharashtra
2. **Muslim Population:** Hostile to Hindu rulers
3. **Sikh Aspirations:** Wanted self-rule

**The Sikh Dynamic:**
> "Even though the bond between Hindu and Sikh was good and solid..."

*The Issue:*
- Marathas were "outright foreigners" in Sikh eyes
- "This was supposed to be our land"
- Sikhs wanted to rule themselves
- Main enemy was Muslims, but also didn't want Maratha rule

---

## The Contractual Obligation

### Why Marathas Had to Stay

**The Mughal Agreement:**
> "The collapse of Mughal authority and the Maratha bond to defend the emperor had placed this responsibility on them."

**What This Meant:**
- Marathas signed contract to protect Mughal Empire
- This included defending Punjab
- Couldn't just abandon it
- Contractual duty to maintain

**The Resource Problem:**
> "However, the Marathas did not possess the resources or the local support to hold the Punjab in strength."

**The Catch-22:**
- Had to defend Punjab (contractual duty)
- Didn't have resources to do it properly
- Couldn't get local support
- Set up for failure

---

## Dattaji's Realization

### Understanding the Difficulty

**The Quick Assessment:**
> "Dattaji did not take long to discern the difficulty of having strong defensive arrangements in Punjab."

**What He Realized:**
- Nearly impossible to maintain strong defense
- Local population against them
- Resources insufficient
- Supply lines too long
- Enemy constantly watching

---

## The Western Push to Sutlej (April 1759)

### Maximum Extent

**By April 1759:**
- Dattaji pushed forward to **River Sutlej**
- Major river flowing through Punjab
- Eventually empties into Indus River (Sindhu)

**Geographic Movement:**
- Moving **westward** into deeper Punjab
- Further from home base
- Closer to Afghan territory

---

## Meeting Sabaji Shinde

### The Peshawar Commander

**Who Was Sabaji:**
- Came from **Peshawar** (far northwest, near Kabul)
- Family member of Dattaji
- Had been stationed watching Afghan invasion route

**The Meeting:**
- Met Dattaji at River Sutlej banks
- Briefed him on ground situation
- Shared intelligence about the region

**The Problem with Sabaji's Position:**
> "Basically Maratha army was highly stretched, overly stretched. Because the job was very difficult and challenging, but the army that they had been given was extremely small."

**The Setup for Failure:**
- Sabaji given critical mission
- But "insufficient forces"
- Expected to defend most vulnerable route
- Not enough resources
- Nearly impossible task

---

## The Historical Context

### First Time This Far North

**Unprecedented:**
> "This is happening for the first time in Maratha history because Marathas had never ever come so much to the north."

**The Pattern with Bajirao I:**
- Even when Bajirao I came north
- Maratha soldiers always wanted to go home
- Would campaign for 6-8 months
- Then: "We want to go home now"

**The New Challenge:**
- Now required to **stay put for long periods**
- They were "not ready" for this
- Cultural/psychological barrier
- Homesickness and distance

**The Enemy Advantage:**
> "Because their enemy was not taking vacation at all."

*Why:*
- Punjab was Afghan/Rohila home territory
- They lived there
- No vacation needed
- Always present, always watching
- Marathas at disadvantage

---

## Strategic Appointments Across Punjab

### The Defensive Network

**After Taking Stock:**
> "After taking stock of the situation with a view to head eastwards, Dattaji appointed several officers to the main towns of the Punjab."

**The Appointments:**

| Location | Commander | Strategic Importance |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Peshawar** | Sabaji Shinde | Western frontier, closest to Afghanistan/Kabul border |
| **Attock** | Tukoji Holkar | Northern defense, strategic town |
| **Multan** | Bappuji Trimbak | Southern Punjab city |
| **Lahore** | Naro Shankar | Punjab capital, central command |

**Note on Tukoji Holkar:**
- From Holkar clan
- But part of the broader Maratha army
- Clans working together in this campaign

---

## Implementing the Peshwa's Strategy

### The Sequential Plan

**The Orders in Earnest:**
> "Dattaji then began to execute the Peshwa's orders in earnest."

**The Plan:**

1. ✅ **Stabilize Punjab** - Done with appointments
2. ✅ **Understand political landscape** - Done through meetings
3. ✅ **Make key appointments** - Done across major towns
4. 🔄 **Prevent outside aggression** - Ongoing mission
5. ⏳ **Next objectives:**
   - Head towards Delhi area
   - Deal with Najeeb Khan
   - Eventually move east toward Bengal

## Major Themes

### 1. Cynical Career Preservation
Malhar Rao's advice to keep problems alive for job security - dark realpolitik.

### 2. The Debt as Disease
Consumption (tuberculosis) metaphor perfectly captures the slow death of Peshwa finances.

### 3. Secret Alliances
Madho Singh coordinating with Abdali while pretending to cooperate - widespread betrayal.

### 4. Impossible Expectations
Commanders given critical missions with insufficient resources - set up to fail.

### 5. Cultural Distance
Marathas trying to govern hostile populations far from home - cultural imperialism failing.

### 6. The Personal vs. Strategic
Malhar Rao's father-son bond with Najeeb overriding strategic necessities.

### 7. Peak and Precipice
Maximum territorial extent coinciding with maximum financial crisis - empire at breaking point.

---

## The Overarching Irony

**Late 1758 = Simultaneous Peak and Crisis:**

*The Peak:*
- Supreme in the north
- Only Bengal remaining for total subcontinent control
- Maximum territorial extent ever achieved
- Delhi under control
- Multiple provinces secured

*The Crisis:*
- Crushing debt described as consumption (fatal disease)
- Northern territories barren from Abdali's raids
- Resources stretched impossibly thin
- Commanders undersupplied
- Secret alliances working against them
- Cultural resistance everywhere
- Financial collapse imminent

**The Question:**
Can they complete the conquest of Bengal before the debt consumes them? Or will the empire collapse under its own weight just as it reaches its greatest extent?

---

*The Marathas stand at the highest point they've ever reached - and it's a precipice. One wrong step and everything collapses. Dattaji Shinde must somehow hold Punjab with insufficient forces, collect tribute from double-dealing Rajput kingdoms, eliminate Najeeb Khan despite Malhar Rao's interference, and then march 2,000 km east to conquer Bengal - all while the debt slowly kills the empire like tuberculosis. No pressure.*
