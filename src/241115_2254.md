## The Father-Son Bond, The Punjab Invitation, & Why Afghans Were Masters of Rivers

---

## The Cow Slaughter Incident

### Religious Tension at the Yamuna

**The Scene:**
- **Yamuna bank** - for taking a dip in the river
- Raghunath Rao sees **Najeeb Khan slaughtering cows**
- **Doesn't like it** (cows sacred to Hindus)

**The Confrontation:**
- **Horkhar** tries to calm Raghunath Rao down
- "Stop it, stop this kind of stuff"
- Najeeb says: **"No, I'm not gonna"**

**Why It Matters:**
- Raghunath Rao and his forces **suffering from feelings of the Hindus**
- Religious offense
- **Najeeb has denied this** (refused to stop)
- Raghunath Rao has **decided to use weapons**

**The Escalation:**
> "Weapons are weapons, weapons are power. He decided to use weapons."

---

## Najeeb Khan Flees (Again)

### The Pattern Continues

**What Happened:**
- Mr. Najeeb Khan and his army
- They just **flee**
- Decide **it's not worth it**

**The Standoff:**
- Both armies came **in front of each other**
- About to engage

---

## Horkhar's Intervention: "Over My Dead Body"

### The Dramatic Block

**The Setup:**
- **Horkhar and his army** was in the **middle of both armies**
- Between Raghunath Rao's forces and Najeeb Khan's forces
- **Dividing them**

**Raghunath Rao's Move:**
- Tried to **sideline** Horkhar
- Go forward (toward Najeeb Khan)

**Horkhar's Response:**
- Invoked **Bajirao I** (Raghunath Rao's father)
> "Even if **Bajirao the First**, that means **your father**, had he been here, he would have **listened to me**. Because **I'm an old timer who worked with your father**."

**The Physical Block:**
- Raghunath Rao **not ready to back down**
- Horkhar **got off the horse**
- **Grabbed the horse's leg** of Raghunath Rao
- Said: "Get off the horse and then go forward"
- "**First go over me** and then only you can go forward"

**Translation:** Over my dead body. 💀

---

## The Result

### Raghunath Rao Backs Down

**What Happened:**
- Raghunath Rao got **very angry**
- But he **came back to his tent**
- Didn't fight Najeeb Khan
- Horkhar successfully stopped the battle

---

## The Father-Son Bond

### Why Horkhar Protected Najeeb Khan

**The Count:**
> "Horkhar had saved the life of Nazeep Khan **twice** because of some objective that was inside him, which was **difficult to fathom for others**."

**He Only Knew:** The real reason was known only to Horkhar.

**The Relationship:**
- **Horkhar considered Najeeb Khan as his son**
- **Najeeb Khan considered Horkhar like his father**
- Deep personal bond
- Not just political alliance

**Why It Mattered:**
> "Nazeep was really lucky that Horkhar was willing to **go to bat for him**."

---

## The Future Problem

### A Headache for Marathas

**The Situation:**
- In the future, this was going to be **difficult for the Marathas**
- Nazeep Khan was going to be **the problem**
- Horkhar was willing to **safeguard him**

**The Assessment:**
> "This was **not the best way forward**, but this was going to be a **headache**."

**Why:**
- Not very **sustainable** for Marathas
- To just let Nazeep run **without any consequence**
- But Horkhar kept protecting him
- Created ongoing problem

---

## The Holy Dip

### After Putting Delhi in Order

**What Happened:**
- After putting Delhi in **proper order**
- Went to holy place for **dip in the Ganges**

**Why the Ganges:**
- For Marathas: **Ganges and Yamuna** both holy
- But **more Ganges** is holy river in itself
- Not something they could do **every day**
- They lived in **far south**
- So it was a **big occasion** when they could do such things

---

## Najeeb Khan's Retreat

### Leaving Saharanpur

**What Happened:**
- Najeeb Khan and his army
- Left the **Saharanpur area**
- At the **foothills of Himalayas**

**The Result:**
- Now Marathas were having **access to all that area**

**His Thinking:**
> "This is getting too hot. So he just decided to **retreat**."

**About Saharanpur:**
- Their **natural area** for Rohila Khand (Rohilas)
- That's where they spent **a lot of time**
- But they **retreated from there**

---

## The Tribute Collection Spree

### Kunjapura & Sirhind

**Kunjapura:**
- Went up to **Kunjapura**
- Got tribute of **5 lakh rupees**
- From some strong man there
- **Majabat Khan** or somebody like that

**Sirhind:**
- **Abdas Samad Khan** (or whoever) was at **Sirhind**
- Sirhind = one of the towns before Punjab
- If you go **west of that**, then you get into **Punjab**
- He took **control of Sirhind**

**The Assessment:**
> "He was having a **good spree**. **Winning spree**."

---

## The Sikhs Rising

### New Power in Punjab

**What Was Happening:**
- The **Sikhs** were now getting **some power**
- Along with them (Marathas), they got hold of **Sirhind**

**Important:** Sikhs were beginning to emerge as a force in the region.

---

## The Punjab Invitation

### Adina Beg's Call

**New Part:**
- **Adina Beg** gave the **invitation** for Marathas to attack Punjab
- (Was he Punjab Subedar? Will come up later)
- But yeah, he **invited Marathas to attack Punjab**

**The Context:**
- Adina Beg came to power after **"this lady"** was kicked out
- The one who **invited Abdali to India**
- (Name forgotten in conversation)

---

## Why Punjab Matters

### The Strategic Importance

**The Geography:**
- Punjab is on the **border**
- Once you **cross Punjab**, you get into **Afghan territory**
- **West of Punjab** = more Afghan

**The Historical Context:**
- When **Aurangzeb** was around
- Even that area was under **Mughal control**
- But then **Abdali came**
- Started making things **difficult**

**How Much Has Changed:**
> "Much has changed here in the **last 50 years** since Aurangzeb's death."

---

## Delhi's Security = Punjab Control

### The Weakest Link

**The Reality:**
> "Delhi's security was **dependent on Punjab's** being able to control Punjab. Because that's how **Abdali would come into India**."

**The Logic:**
- Punjab you **have to control**
- Otherwise, very **easy for Abdali** to come into India
- It's the **weakest link**

**Who Needs to Control It:**
- Has to be in the hands of either **Mughals or Marathas**
- Mughals now were **not very powerful** (implied)

---

## The Punjab Power Structure

### Taimur Shah vs Adina Beg

**In Lahore:**
- **Taimur Shah** (Abdali's son)
- Was like in his **teenage** (11 years old mentioned)
- Was the **Subedar**
- Supposed to be taking care of Punjab
- Lahore = **capital of Punjab**

**In Jalandhar:**
- **Adina Beg**
- His writ went up to **Jalandhar**
- Not quite as **west as Lahore**
- Living in kind of **uneasy peace** with Taimur Shah

---

## Adina Beg's Betrayal

### Breaking with Taimur Shah

**What Changed:**
- Adina Beg **did not cooperate** with Taimur
- **Called Raghunath Rao for help**
- Basically decided **not to cooperate** with Taimur Shah anymore

**Why:**
- Share the **power or income** or whatever
- Taimur Shah was in Lahore
- Hoping to get control of **entire Punjab**
- That was **Abdali's dream**

**The Problem:**
> "That wasn't their conventional kingdom or conventional province because that has **nothing to do with Afghanistan**."

**But:**
- Because Abdali was a **strong man**
- He thought he had to get Punjab
- Keep it going

---

## The Hatred of Jahan Khan

### Punjab's Resentment

**Who He Was:**
- **Jahan Khan** = commander-in-chief of Abdali
- People in Punjab **hated** him

**The Threat:**
> "At any given time, there could be a **revolt against the Afghan rule** in Lahore."

**Why He Was There:**
- Probably stationed in **Lahore**
- Because Taimur Shah was **barely a teenage boy**
- Obviously doesn't know how to wage war
- Jahan Khan = **adult in the room**
- He was the **commander-in-chief**

---

## The Money Offer

### One Lakh Rupees Per Day

**Adina Beg's Promise:**
- Promised Marathas he would help them
- By giving them **1 lakh rupees a day** 💰
- **Hundred thousand rupees EVERY DAY**

**Why Marathas Agreed:**
> "It was a **monetary offer** that they thought was **attractive**. They were working like **soldiers of fortune**, more or less."

**The Common Theme:** Getting paid lots and lots.

---

## Abdali's Punjab Problem

### The Back-and-Forth

**The History:**
- Abdali had **tried to take control three times** before
- **Failed** - meaning it was going **back and forth**
- He's installing his Subedar
- Then Marathas or Mughals would drive them out
- **In contention**

**Now:**
- Marathas were thinking of getting **their control** on Punjab
- That was their **objective**

---

## The March to Lahore

### From Sirhind

**What Happened:**
- Marathas took off **from Sirhind toward Lahore**

**Jahan Khan's Response:**
- Was in Lahore (commander-in-chief of Abdali)
- Decided to **go meet Marathas midway** (probably)

**The Problem:**
- Because of **huge force** that Marathas had assembled
- He kind of **lost his courage**
- Maybe didn't have enough army with him
- Just thought: **not going to be easy to win that battle**

**The Result:**
> "He **lost his will to fight**."

---

## Abdali's Afghan Problem

### Can't Send Reinforcements

**The Hope:**
- Jahan Khan and Taimur Shah were hoping
- They will get some **extra troops from Abdali** in Afghanistan

**The Reality:**
- Abdali himself was trying to **pacify the revolt**
- In certain areas of Afghanistan
- There are **lots of tribes**
- They have local **strongholds**

**What Abdali Was Trying to Do:**
- Develop a **nationwide government presence**
- Make sure all the tribes **come with him**
- But they're **fiercely independent tribes**

**The Challenge:**
> "He was trying to bring it under **one rule** (his rule), but that was **not going to be easy**. He has to basically **pacify them** in their own stronghold areas."

**The Consequence:**
- He **couldn't send any extra troops**
- Because he **needed them himself**
- Couldn't afford it
- **Stretching too thin**

---

## The Ravi River Crossing

### Afghan Retreat Strategy

**What Happened:**
- Afghans **left Lahore**
- **Crossed the Ravi**
- Probably felt a **little safe**

**Why:**
- By crossing the river, thought they **wouldn't be followed**
- And even if they were:
- Crossing the river for Maratha army = **not a given**
- **Difficult maneuver**

**The Logistics:**
- For such a big force
- Wasn't happening easily
- Would be **easily noticeable**
- With all your **camels, elephants, horses**
- Would take **some time**

---

## Afghan Mastery of Rivers

### Their Secret Advantage

**The Skill:**
- Afghans had **mastered that art**
- Not of "retreat strategically"
- Of **crossing the rivers**

**Why They Had To:**
> "To come to Delhi, he had to cross **at least four or five rivers**."

**The Result:**
- That was something he had **developed**
- Asked (mastered)
- **Strategic advantage**

---

## Critical Insights

### Why Horkhar's Protection Matters

**The Problem:**
- Najeeb Khan = ongoing threat
- Horkhar = powerful Maratha veteran
- **But protects the enemy**
- Creates impossible situation

**The Relationship:**
- Father-son bond (not blood)
- Deep personal connection
- Loyalty overrides strategy
- "Difficult to fathom for others"

**The Future:**
- Najeeb Khan WILL be a problem
- Horkhar WILL protect him
- Marathas can't touch Najeeb while Horkhar lives
- **Not sustainable**

---

### The "Over My Dead Body" Moment

**What It Shows:**
- Horkhar's **courage** (blocking his own commander)
- His **authority** (invoked Bajirao I)
- His **physicality** (grabbed horse's leg)
- His **determination** (literally "go over me")

**Why Raghunath Rao Backed Down:**
- Horkhar was respected veteran
- Worked with his father (Bajirao I)
- **"Old timer"** with credibility
- Couldn't dishonor him publicly
- Got angry but **came back to tent**

**The Significance:**
- Shows Horkhar's power within Maratha ranks
- Shows limits of Raghunath Rao's authority
- Shows deep bonds transcend politics
- **Foreshadows problems** when loyalties conflict

---

### The Money Trail

**The Offer:**
- **1 lakh rupees PER DAY**
- That's **100,000 rupees daily**
- From Adina Beg

**The Math:**
- If campaign lasts months...
- That's **millions of rupees**
- Very attractive offer

**But:**
- Remember from other transcripts
- They came back **80 lakh MORE in debt**
- So where did the money go?
- **Adina Beg didn't deliver?**
- Or it all went to expenses?

**The Pattern:**
- "Soldiers of fortune"
- Working for money
- But **not bringing profit home**
- Just spending to maintain army

---

### Abdali's Vulnerability

**The Window:**
- Abdali **can't send reinforcements**
- Busy with tribal revolts
- Fiercely independent Afghan tribes
- Trying to create central government
- **Never happened before in Afghanistan**

**The Task:**
- Pacify tribes in their strongholds
- Bring them under one rule (his rule)
- Not going to be easy
- **Stretching too thin**

**The Opportunity:**
- Jahan Khan **lost courage**
- Taimur Shah just a **teenage boy**
- No reinforcements coming
- Afghans **fleeing**

**But:**
- This is **temporary**
- Abdali WILL pacify the tribes (eventually)
- Then he'll be **back**
- With full force

---

### Afghan River Mastery

**Why It Matters:**
- Had to cross **4-5 rivers** to reach Delhi
- **Developed and mastered** the technique
- Strategic skill

**The Advantage:**
- Can retreat across rivers safely
- **Difficult maneuver** for pursuers
- Time-consuming with elephants, camels, horses
- **Easily noticeable**
- Gives them defensive position

**The Implication:**
- Marathas **not as skilled** at river crossings
- Afghans use this as defensive tactic
- **Natural barrier** they exploit
- Part of why they can raid and retreat successfully

---

## Foreshadowing

### What's Coming

**The Horkhar Problem:**
- He'll keep protecting Najeeb
- Creates ongoing headache
- Not sustainable for Marathas
- Eventually something has to give

**The Abdali Return:**
- He's temporarily busy
- But he's pacifying those tribes
- When he's done → he's coming back
- With full force
- Jahan Khan and Taimur Shah waiting

**The Money Problem:**
- 1 lakh per day promised
- But we know they end up MORE in debt
- Something goes wrong
- Either Adina Beg doesn't pay
- Or costs exceed revenue

**The River Crossings:**
- Afghans mastered them
- Marathas less skilled
- Will matter in future battles
- Geographic advantage for Afghans

**The Sikhs:**
- Getting "some power"
- Rising force
- Will be factor in Punjab
- Wild card in future conflicts

---

**1757-1758: Horkhar's finest hour and the seed of future problems. Raghunath Rao wants to fight Najeeb Khan over cow slaughter at the Yamuna. Horkhar physically blocks him - gets off his horse, grabs Raghunath Rao's horse's leg. "Even your father Bajirao would have listened to me. I'm an old timer. First go over me, then you can go forward." Over my dead body. Raghunath Rao backs down, furious but respectful. Horkhar saved Najeeb twice now. Father-son bond, not blood but deeper. Will be a headache for Marathas. Meanwhile, Najeeb retreats from Saharanpur. Marathas on winning spree - 5 lakh from Kunjapura, control of Sirhind with rising Sikhs. Then Adina Beg's golden invitation: "Come attack Punjab, I'll give you 1 lakh rupees PER DAY." Soldiers of fortune say yes. They march from Sirhind to Lahore. Jahan Khan sees the force, loses courage, loses will to fight. Hopes for reinforcements from Abdali. But Abdali's busy - fiercely independent Afghan tribes revolting, trying to create central government, stretching too thin, can't send help. So Afghans flee Lahore, cross the Ravi River. Their secret advantage: mastered river crossings (had to, coming to Delhi requires crossing 4-5 rivers). Defensive position now. But window is open. Abdali's vulnerable. For now.**
