# Mughal Court Politics & Maratha Intervention (1754)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## The Eunuch Emperor Strategy

Someone (likely a power broker in Delhi) chose a **eunuch** to become the new emperor. 

**Why a eunuch?**
- Believed to be more obedient and controllable
- Unlike Imad-ul-Mulk (who wasn't a eunuch and became scheming), this guy was expected to be reliable
- Previously a servant - this was an upgrade for him
- The theory: he wouldn't create trouble and would stay under command

**The Problem:** There must be loyalists who remained loyal to Udham Bai and the previous emperor. And Imad-ul-Mulk has sided with them. Time for a coup!

---

## Safdar Jang's Failed Power Play

### The Emperor's Dilemma

Safdar Jang's scheming backfired spectacularly. By "adding oil to the fire," he created so much instability in Delhi that the emperor had no choice but to call in the Marathas.

**What went wrong:**
- Safdar Jang invited Surajmal Jat to Delhi
- This created major instability 
- Things spiraled out of control
- Emperor forced to rely on Maratha military power

### The Maratha Forces Already in Delhi

The Marathas weren't starting from scratch - they already had a military presence:
- **3,000-5,000 fighters** stationed in Delhi
- Under command of **Antaji Mankeshwar**
- Ready to be mobilized

---

## The Coalition Defeats Safdar Jang

### The Winning Team

**Imad-ul-Mulk + Antaji Mankeshwar + Rajendra Gir Gosavi** formed an alliance that crushed Safdar Jang's forces.

> **Rajendra Gir Gosavi:** Identity unclear - definitely not Muslim, probably not Maratha. May get more info later. Likely not with Surajmal/Madhav Singh since they're in opposite camps.

**Result:** Safdar Jang's forces were completely defeated and routed.

---

## The Rohilla Wild Card

### Najeeb Khan Rohila Enters the Game

**Najeeb Khan** = Rohilla sardar/warrior who opposed Safdar Jang

**The Enemy-of-My-Enemy Logic:**
- Rohillas normally oppose Marathas
- Marathas were siding with Imad-ul-Mulk and the Emperor
- But Rohillas **hated** Safdar Jang even more
- So they chose to oppose Safdar Jang (picking between two evils)

### Court Factions Reminder

Two major groups in the Mughal court:
1. **Rohilla/Afghan group**
2. **Persian courtiers**

Safdar Jang belonged to the Persian faction, which the Rohillas despised.

---

## The Three Maratha Commanders

Nana Saheb Peshwa (in Pune) sent three heavy hitters north to Delhi:

| Commander | Role/Background |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Malhar Rao Holkar** | Major Maratha commander |
| **Jayapa Shinde** | Major Maratha commander |
| **Raghunath Rao Peshwa** | Nana Saheb's younger brother |

### Raghunath Rao: The Ambitious Brother

**Family Tree:**
- Father: Bajirao I (the legendary Peshwa)
- Elder brother: **Nana Saheb Peshwa** (current Peshwa - got the throne as elder son)
- Younger brother: **Raghunath Rao Peshwa** (this guy)

**Character traits:**
- Extremely ambitious
- Good fighter himself
- Will play a huge role in future events
- **Spoiler alert:** He will eventually kill Nana Saheb's son (**Narayan Rao**) because he wants the Peshwa position for himself

**Current status:** Not creating trouble *yet* because tradition dictates the elder son inherits. But his ambition is simmering...

---

## Plot Twist: Too Little, Too Late

**BEFORE** the three Maratha commanders could reach Delhi:
- Safdar Jang's army was already defeated
- He retreated back to **Awadh** (his home territory)

So the big cavalry arrived after the main battle was over!

---

## The Peace Brokers

Two characters stepped forward to negotiate a truce between the emperor and Safdar Jang:

### 1. Madhav Singh
- **King of Jaipur** (Rajasthan)
- Regional power broker

### 2. Shuja-ud-Daula
- **Son of Safdar Jang** himself
- About to become a MAJOR player in future events
- **His mother:** Daughter of Safdar Jang's uncle (who originally invited Safdar Jang to India from Iran)
- Mother described as thoughtful and intelligent

> **CRITICAL CHARACTER ALERT:** Shuja-ud-Daula will be at the center of the next several years of conflict. Remember this name!

---

## The Pardon

**Safdar Jang** and **Surajmal Jat** were both pardoned for their "stupidities" and the trouble they created.

**Surajmal Jat's territory:** Vassal king in **Bharatpur** (close to Agra)

---

## Imad-ul-Mulk's Revenge Plot

### The Problem

Imad-ul-Mulk was **NOT happy** with the pardons. He believed these two needed to be punished properly.

### The Challenge

Imad-ul-Mulk challenged the Marathas to conquer:
1. **Awadh**
2. **Allahabad**

Both were prosperous areas under Safdar Jang's governorship.

**The Strategy:**
- If Marathas take these territories, Safdar Jang loses his power base
- Remember: The emperor had already offered tax collection rights to Antaji Mankeshwar
- This was the **completion of the original conspiracy** to take down Safdar Jang

---

## Why Allahabad Matters

### Religious Significance (Prayagraj)

Allahabad = modern-day **Prayagraj** = meeting point of three holy rivers:

| River | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Ganga** | Active, flowing |
| **Yamuna** | Active, flowing |
| **Saraswati** | Mythical/historical - went underground, no longer visible |

**Historical note:** Saraswati used to be a huge, flowing river. Now only Ganga and Yamuna meet there, creating the **Ganga-Yamuna confluence**.

**Why Marathas wanted it:**
- Holy site = religious importance
- Rich agricultural region (on the Gangetic plain)
- Strategic location

---

## The Split: Shuja-ud-Daula's Loyalty

### The Father-Son Conflict

**Shuja-ud-Daula refused** Imad-ul-Mulk's plan.

**His position:**
- The friendship treaty with Safdar Jang (his father) and Surajmal Jat should remain intact
- No new hostilities should be created
- "What's done is done"

**Result:** This created a **rift between Imad-ul-Mulk and Shuja-ud-Daula**

---

## The Degradation of Mughal Politics

### Everything is Falling Apart

- Alliances constantly shifting
- Corruption skyrocketing
- Nobody knew who was calling the shots anymore
- Everyone acting purely for profit/self-interest

**Examples of alliance chaos:**
- First Marathas were desirable allies
- Then Madhav Singh and Surajmal Jat were preferred
- Loyalties changing constantly

### The Stage is Set for Tragedy

With the arrival of the three Maratha commanders, combined with Imad-ul-Mulk's **intense desire for revenge**, the next chapter of tragedy was about to be written.

---

## The Two Factions

By the end of this session, two clear sides had emerged:

### FACTION 1: The Maratha-Imad Alliance
- **Marathas** (Malhar Rao Holkar, Jayapa Shinde, Raghunath Rao Peshwa)
- **Imad-ul-Mulk** (seeking revenge)
- Ready to attack Awadh and Allahabad

### FACTION 2: The Awadh Alliance  
- **Shuja-ud-Daula** (son of Safdar Jang, maintaining loyalty)
- **Surajmal Jat** (Bharatpur king)
- **Safdar Jang** (weakened but still in Awadh)

---

## Key Players

| Name | Role | Affiliation |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Eunuch Emperor** | New emperor (puppet?) | Mughal Court |
| **Imad-ul-Mulk** | Wazir/Power broker | Mughal Court - anti-Safdar Jang |
| **Antaji Mankeshwar** | Commander | Maratha - stationed in Delhi |

| **Madhav Singh** | King of Jaipur | Rajasthan - peace broker |
| **Surajmal Jat** | King | Bharatpur (near Agra) |

## Timeline Context

**Year: ~1754** (around the same time as the Kumbher Fort siege)

---

## Geographic Context

**Key Locations:**
- **Delhi** - Mughal capital (chaos central)
- **Awadh** - Safdar Jang's territory (eastern region)
- **Allahabad/Prayagraj** - Holy city, target of Maratha expansion
- **Bharatpur** - Surajmal Jat's kingdom (near Agra)

## What's Coming Next

The arrival of the three Maratha commanders + Imad-ul-Mulk's thirst for revenge = recipe for disaster.

**Questions left hanging:**
- Will the Marathas attack Awadh and Allahabad?
- How will Shuja-ud-Daula respond?
- What role will Raghunath Rao's ambition play?
- Is Imad-ul-Mulk engineering something sinister?

**Two factions ready to clash:**
- Marathas + Imad-ul-Mulk (aggressors)
- Shuja-ud-Daula + Safdar Jang + Surajmal Jat (defenders)

---

*The Mughal Empire is basically a reality TV show at this point - alliances shifting daily, everyone scheming, nobody knows who's really in charge, and a bunch of powerful military commanders just showed up ready to throw down. Buckle up!*
