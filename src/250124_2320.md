# Bhau's March Speed: Defending Against the Critics (1760)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

## The March from Sindakhed: Why Leave in March?

### The Dilemma

**When Bhau Left:**
- Departed from **Sindakhed in March 1760**
- **Three months before monsoon** begins (early June)

**Why This Was Problematic:**
- Three months = **not enough time** for large army
- Had to cross multiple rivers
- Cover enormous distance (850 miles)
- Would get stuck when monsoon hits

**The Calculation:**
> "June 5th or 7th, monsoon begins. Everybody knows that."

**What Happens:**
- Leave in March
- Travel for 3 months
- End up reaching target around **mid-June**
- Right when **monsoon floods everything**
- "Then you're grounded. You have to be grounded."

---

## Why Leave So Late Then?

### The Urgency

**The Problem:**
- Shinde and Holkar armies in the north
- "Totally ineffective"
- Getting beaten up
- Losing control of the situation

**The Necessity:**
> "Something had to be done."

**The Trade-off:**
- Bad to leave in March (monsoon timing)
- Worse to stay in Pune (lose the north)
- No good options
- **Had to respond**

**The Reality:**
- They couldn't defend themselves
- "Nobody will take them seriously"
- Tax collection would stop
- Tribute collection would stop
- **Everything would collapse** without reinforcement

---

## The Critics' Argument

### What People Say

**The Common Criticism:**
> "Bhau's army was going too slow. Why did it take so long to get to the north?"

**The Logic:**
- Had he reached Delhi **before June 5-7** (before monsoon)
- Would have been "a different matter"
- Could have created favorable conditions
- Everything would have been reversed

**The Claim:**
> "Had Bhau been there earlier, then he would have created a very tough situation for Abdali."

**The Counterfactual:**
- Get there earlier = defeat Abdali
- Win the battle with Abdali
- Change the whole situation in his favor
- Victory instead of disaster

---

## The Defense: Army Speed in the 18th Century

### The Author's Rebuttal

**The Core Argument:**
> "At that time the army used to travel at a very slow pace."

**Why This Matters:**
- This wasn't Bhau being slow
- This was **normal for 18th century armies**
- Criticism doesn't make sense
- **"It wasn't feasible"** to go faster

---

## Historical Army Speed Comparisons

### Example 1: Farrukhsiyar (1722)

**Who He Was:**
- Mughal Emperor
- From the book "Army of the Mughals" by Irwin (1713)

**His March:**
- **September 23, 1722:** Left Patna
- **January 4, 1723:** Reached Agra (Sarai Begum)

**The Math:**
- Took **~4-5 months**
- That's the pace of Mughal armies
- "That was kind of a given"

---

### Example 2: 1723 March (Also from Irwin)

**The Statistics:**
- **106 days** to cover **585 miles**
- Works out to **~5 miles per day**

**The Significance:**
> "That's a very slow pace."

**Comparing to Bhau:**
- Bhau did **850 miles in 120 days**
- Works out to **~7-8 miles per day**
- Actually **better than the Mughals**

**The Verdict:**
> "So he wasn't as bad, you know, he was competitive. Better than that."

---

### Example 3: Bajirao Vishwanath & Hussain Ali (1718)

**Who They Were:**
- **Bajirao Vishwanath** = Peshwa at the time
- **Bajirao I** also went with him (as his son)
- **Hussain Ali** = one of the Sayyid Brothers

**The Mission:**
- Went from **Aurangabad to Delhi**
- **98 days** to complete the journey

**Why They Went:**
- Rescue people taken hostage by Aurangzeb
- Shahru, his mother, stepbrothers, others
- They were taken to Delhi
- Went with **small army** to get them back

**The Other Goal:**
- Secure the **Chaut** (one-fourth tax) from Mughal Emperor
- Get **Subhas** (provinces) in their name
- This was when they **secured those rights** (1718)

**The Distance:**
> "Aurangabad to Delhi is a much shorter distance than from Pune to Delhi."

**Yet:**
- Still took **98 days**
- With a **small army**
- Much lighter than Bhau's force

---

## Bhau's Special Handicap: The Artillery

### Why Bhau Was Even Slower

**What He Carried:**
- **Heavy artillery**
- Long-distance French cannons
- Massive guns

**The Problem:**
> "Someone literally had to be pushing or these horses had to be pulling these cannons."

**The Reality:**
- Not horses - **bulls** pulled the cannons
- "Horses don't do it. It's the bulls."
- Bulls had to be **very strong**
- "They could only walk at a certain pace"

**Why He Brought Them:**
- Believed in the artillery
- Had seen it work at **Udgir battle** against Nizam
- Long-distance artillery was his ace
- "He was a believer"

**The Calculation:**
> "Nobody knew who would win [without the artillery]. It would be a toss-up."

**His Confidence:**
> "He believed that [artillery] will give him the win."

---

## The Dholpur Stop: One Month Camp

### What Happened

**At Dholpur:**
- Bhau "just camped and stayed there for **a month**"
- Not moving, just waiting

**Even With That:**
> "So even with that, his overall speed wasn't too slow."

**The Calculation:**
- Including the one-month Dholpur stop
- His average speed still competitive with historical armies
- Still did ~7-8 miles per day overall

---

## The Bottom Line

### The Verdict on Bhau's Speed

**The Conclusion:**
> "In the 18th century, when armies travelled long distance, that is how it was. So he was not doing anything below par."

**Even Accounting For:**
- One month stopped at Dholpur
- Heavy artillery slowing him down
- Massive army (80,000+ soldiers + 50-60,000 civilians)
- Terrible timing (monsoon)

**Still:**
- Competitive with historical examples
- Actually **faster** than Farrukhsiyar
- Only slightly slower than Bajirao/Hussain Ali (who had small, light force)

## Key Comparisons Table

| Army | Year | Distance | Time | Speed | Notes |
|------|------|----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Farrukhsiyar** | 1722 | Patna â†' Agra | 4-5 months | ~4-5 mi/day | Mughal emperor, typical pace |
| **Irwin Example** | 1723 | 585 miles | 106 days | ~5 mi/day | Standard Mughal army |
| **Bajirao & Hussain Ali** | 1718 | Aurangabad â†' Delhi | 98 days | ~6-7 mi/day | Small army, shorter distance |
| **Bhau** | 1760 | Pune â†' Delhi | 120 days | **~7-8 mi/day** | Heavy artillery, huge army, stopped 1 month |

## The Monsoon Problem Revisited

### Why It Mattered So Much

**The Timing:**
- March departure = arrives mid-June
- Monsoon begins early June
- **Soggy earth, flooded rivers**
- "Not meant for armies to be on march"
- Animals can't walk properly
- Bullock carts stuck

**The Historical Pattern:**
> "Nobody did that in India ever because generally armies went to battle probably by November."

**The Scale:**
- 80,000+ soldiers
- 50-60,000 civilians
- **"Like big village moving"** from place to place

---

## Why Critics Miss the Point

### The Constraints Were Real

**What Critics Ignore:**
1. **18th century armies were slow** - that's just how it was
2. **Heavy artillery** - bulls can only move so fast
3. **Massive scale** - 130,000+ people total
4. **Rivers to cross** - took month just for Chambar (small river!)
5. **No better alternatives** - had to leave in March (Shinde/Holkar losing)

**What Would Have Worked:**
- Leave in **November or December** (previous year)
- Arrive by **March/April** (before monsoon)
- Plenty of time to position forces
- Cross rivers when they're low (pre-monsoon)
- Fight in favorable conditions

**Why That Didn't Happen:**
- Situation in north wasn't critical yet in late 1759
- By time it became urgent (Jan/Feb 1760)
- Too late to arrive before monsoon
- Forced into bad timing

---

## The Artillery Question

### Why Not Leave It Behind?

**Holkar Later Says:**
- Store heavy guns at **Gwalior fort**
- Use **cavalry** for quick movements
- Do **surgical strikes** instead
- Gherao (surround) tactics, not frontal battle

**Why Bhau Disagreed:**
- Seen artillery work at Udgir
- Confident it would win the battle
- "Only thing he could believe in"
- Without it = total toss-up
- "Nobody knew who would win"

**The Trade-off:**
- Artillery = confidence in victory
- Artillery = slow march = bad timing
- But without it = maybe no chance at all?

---

## Critical Themes

### 1. The Impossible Choice
Leave early with incomplete preparation, or leave late and get caught by monsoon. There was no good option by March 1760.

### 2. The Technology Paradox
Artillery might win the battle, but it guarantees you'll arrive at the wrong time. Faster march might mean better timing, but losing the battle anyway.

### 3. The Historical Context
Criticism of Bhau's speed ignores that **no 18th century army moved faster** with that kind of scale and equipment. He actually beat historical averages.

### 4. The Constraints Compound
- Heavy artillery (slow)
- Huge army (slow)
- Multiple rivers (slow)
- One-month stop (slow)
- Monsoon approaching (time pressure)
- Still faster than Mughal armies

### 5. The Counterfactual Problem
"If only he'd gotten there earlier" assumes he **could have** gotten there earlier. The historical evidence suggests: no, he couldn't.

---

## Where We Left Off

**The Situation:**
- Bhau's speed was **competitive with 18th century standards**
- Actually **better than Mughal armies**
- But still arrived **right as monsoon hit**
- The timing was forced by **March departure** (responding to crisis)
- The critics have a point about timing
- But miss the constraints that made faster march impossible

**The Question:**
- Could **anyone** have done it faster?
- Or was the disaster **baked in** once they left in March?
- The historical evidence suggests: once you leave in March with heavy artillery and a massive army, you're screwed by monsoon no matter what you do.

---

*The critics say Bhau was too slow. The historical record says he was actually pretty fast for an 18th century army carrying heavy artillery. But both miss the real point: the disaster wasn't the slow march - it was the impossible choice between abandoning the north or marching into monsoon. By March 1760, there were no good options left.*
