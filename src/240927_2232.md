# Maratha Warfare Crisis & The Road to Kumbher (1754)
## Marathi History Book Reading Session Summary

---

## Chapter Continues: "Marathas Win Wars, Lose Friends"

### The Impossible Position (Recap)

**The Maratha dilemma:**
- Mughal Emperor at Delhi = **appendage they could do without**
- **On one hand:** Sworn to protect him (Ahadnama contract)
- **On the other hand:** Mughal court free to deal and grant awards as it deemed fit
- **Result:** Marathas left to resolve the consequences

**The competition:** Regional powers (Rohillas/Najib Khan, Awadh, Abdali, Nizam, Siddhi of Janjira, English, Portuguese) were all:
- Self-contained
- Compact
- Reacted quickly
- Focused efficiently
- âŒ **Way more efficient than the Marathas**

---

## The Old Ways vs. New Technology

### The Peshwa's Court: Yes-Men Problem

**The traditional governance:**
- Peshwa's governance followed **age-old traditions**
- Courtiers focused on **keeping the Peshwa happy**
- âŒ Rather than telling him the **truth**

**The danger:**
- Not getting honest feedback
- Echo chamber effect
- Missing critical information

---

## The Technology Gap: A Fatal Weakness

### New European Weapons Arriving

**What was happening:**
- New weapons and techniques from Europeans being adopted
- Peshwa's army getting access to new technology
- **BUT** this created **new dangers and risks**

### Why This Was Critical

**The problem:**
- Maratha army was **NOT used to new techniques of warfare**
- Still trained in **old-style battle techniques and strategies**
- Traditional Maratha warfare = guerrilla tactics, surprise attacks
- European warfare = disciplined regiments, frontal battles, cannon warfare

**Quote from source:** "This is a very, very important point."

---

## The Cannon Disaster at Panipat (Foreshadowing)

### What Sadashiv Rao Adopted

**The plan:**
- Adopted **long-range cannons** (French technology and training)
- These could fire 1.5 to 2 kilometers
- Seemed like the perfect solution for flat-land battles

### The Maratha Army Wasn't Ready

**The cultural problem:**
- Maratha army more used to **old-style contact warfare**
- âŒ Not comfortable with this new cannon-centric strategy
- Traditional preference: surgical strikes, hit-and-run

**This inexperience with cannon warfare = one of the reasons they lost at Panipat.**

---

## The Battle of Panipat: How the Cannons Failed

### The Setup

**Initial situation:**
- Cannon force positioned **out in front**
- Battle begins with cannons firing
- Long-range cannons (1.5-2 km range)
- **Incredibly effective** - scorching the enemy
- Enemy soldiers getting burnt, starting to flee
- **Cannons were winning the battle!**

### The Ego Problem

**What the front Maratha troops thought:**
- "If the cannons win the war, the **cannon force gets ALL the credit**"
- "What will become of us?"
- "Peshwas will have no use for us!"

### The Fatal Decision

**What they did:**
- Front Maratha troops were told to **wait**
- Let cannons do their job of **softening enemy lines**
- This was crucial to the strategy

**But after 4-5 hours:**
- Front troops **couldn't wait anymore**
- They **launched their own attack** on enemy lines
- Charged ahead without coordination

**The consequence:**
- Once Maratha troops surged ahead → **cannons had to stop firing**
- Risk of hitting their own troops
- **"All hell breaks loose"**

### Why This Happened

**Root cause:**
- Marathas had never seen cannon force being so effective
- Didn't understand the **discipline** it demanded from the rest of the army
- Not used to this style of battle
- Lacked maturity with the new technology

**The lesson:** Having money to buy cannons ≠ Having expertise to use them properly

---

## The Philosophical Divide in Maratha Army

### The Shivaji Doctrine

**What Shivaji taught:**
- **Surgical strike when enemy least expects you**
- Hit and vanish within 2-3 hours
- Maximum destruction, minimum exposure
- **Never fight frontal battles**

### The Old Guard Resistance

**Certain contingents simply did not like frontal warfare:**
- "This is totally wrong"
- "We should NOT be fighting battles like this"
- "We should fall upon the enemy when they least expect"
- "Then vanish after making destruction in enemy camp"

**There were fundamental disagreements within the army.**

---

## Sadashiv Rao Bhau's Conviction

### Why He Insisted on Frontal Warfare

**His logic:**
- In northern plains, **there is no mountain**
- Can't use guerrilla tactics (no terrain advantage)
- Fighting a **very strong enemy** (Abdali)
- This is the **only way** to fight in the north

### The Problem: Couldn't Convince Everyone

**Major commanders who disagreed:**
- **Holkar** believed in old-fashioned warfare
- Never believed in frontal attacks
- "Just couldn't take it"
- Eventually **left early** with his troops

**Note:** Why Holkar left is important and will be explained more later, but the tactical disagreement was a major factor.

## The European vs. Maratha Fighting Styles

### European Methods

**What Europeans brought:**
- **Disciplined troops**
- Regiments behaving in coordinated fashion
- Collective action as a group
- Concurrent, synchronized movements

### Maratha Strengths & Weaknesses

**What Marathas were good at:**
- **Individual bravery**
- Personal valor and skill

**What Marathas struggled with:**
- **Collective action as an army**
- Working in disciplined fashion as a group
- Coordinated large-scale operations
- âŒ **Infighting for credit**

### The Transition Period

**The situation circa 1754:**
- Unsettling period of change
- Old methods being challenged
- Transition had **just started**
- Later they got better at it
- But timing was wrong - still learning

---

## The European Enclaves: Technology Creates Power

### Why Europeans Could Establish Settlements

**The reason:**
- Their weapons and techniques were **different** from age-old Indian methods
- Superior technology = leverage to carve out territory
- They **didn't modernize** unlike their contemporaries
- This gave Europeans footholds (French, British, Portuguese)

**The Europeans developed their own enclaves within India** because of this technological advantage.

---

## Political Dynamics: Why Sadashiv Rao Wasn't Sent North Earlier

### The Representation Problem

**What the Marathas needed:**
- Very able courtier representative in Mughal court in Delhi
- Someone present to represent Maratha interests
- **Antaji Mankeshwar** was one such person

### Nana Saheb's Insecurity

**The fear:**
- If Sadashiv Rao was appointed as **regent in the north**
- He could become a **threat to the Peshwa position itself**

**Why this was concerning:**

1. **Sadashiv Rao could challenge Nana Saheb's position in Pune**
   - By winning more battles
   - Making himself look good
   - Taking credit for good actions

2. **Much more wealth and power in the north**
   - Mughals were weak but still had lots of wealth
   - He could accumulate massive resources
   - Potential to take over Mughal Empire in Delhi
   - Displace the emperor himself
   - "Free Mughal Empire for himself"

3. **Succession concerns**
   - Nana Saheb wanted to pass throne to his son: **Vishwas Rao**
   - If Sadashiv Rao (cousin) got all the credit in north
   - Would undermine Vishwas Rao's case to be next Peshwa

**The strategy:**
- Keep Sadashiv Rao **busy with Karnataka campaign** (in the south)
- Could have been relieved and sent north
- But Nana Saheb **wanted him under leash**
- Trusted him (family) but **couldn't let him shine too brightly**

---

## Raghunath Rao: The Young Prodigy

### Early Success

**At barely 18 years old:**
- Won over **Ahmedabad** from the Mughals (Gujarat)
- Very impressive achievement

**Who is he:**
- Younger brother of **Nana Saheb Peshwa** (NOT brother of Vishwas Rao)
- Uncle to Vishwas Rao
- Direct brother to the Peshwa
- Sadashiv Rao Bhau was his cousin

---

## Why Raghunath Rao Was Sent North

### The Reasoning

**Why these three were chosen:**
- **Jayapa Shinde** - senior commander
- **Malhar Rao Holkar** - senior commander
- **Raghunath Rao Peshwa** - younger brother of Peshwa

### Multiple Reasons for Raghunath Rao

1. **Sovereign questions:** Could handle matters requiring Peshwa-level authority

2. **Fighter credentials:** Was a warrior, not just administrator

3. **Royal family aura:** People trusted him when he said something (family connection)

4. **Mediation needed:** Shinde and Holkar **didn't get along at all**
   - Needed someone who could lead both
   - They wouldn't listen to each other
   - Raghunath Rao = mediator between rivals

---

## The Mission: Take Agra and Ajmer

### The Situation When They Arrived

**By the time the decision was made and they traveled north:**
- Safdar Jang already defeated
- Back in Awadh
- âŒ No need to fight him

**New mission (per the Ahadnama):**
- Take control of **two provinces:**
  1. **Agra**
  2. **Ajmer**

---

## The Jat Problem in Agra

### Not a Simple Affair

**The complication:**
- Agra district/province = **stronghold of Jat people**
- Jats = Hindus, warrior caste
- Giving trouble since **Aurangzeb's time**
- Not easy opponents

### Why Jats Would Resist

**The Jat perspective:**
- âŒ "Marathas want to take control of Agra?"
- âŒ "We're originally from here"
- âŒ "Not going to like it"
- One thing for emperor to give it away
- Another for Marathas to just take it
- **Would be treated as outsiders, usurper force**

**The reality:** Jats were already competitors to Mughals. They were no slouch. Not giving Marathas an easy time.

---

## Surajmal Jat: The Shrewd King

### Who He Is

**Surajmal Jat:**
- King in Agra (or nearby Agra)
- Very shrewd personality
- Built good forts **south of Delhi**

**His fortifications:**
- Not perfectly flat land
- Some hills (not mountains like Sahyadri)
- Not mountainous region
- But enough elevation to build fortifications
- Not purely Bhui Kot - kind of in between

### His Alliance Choice

**Surajmal's fatal decision:**
- Had sided with **Safdar Jang** during the conflict
- Emperor had forgiven him
- **But Imad-ul-Mulk was still upset**
- Wanted revenge

### Imad-ul-Mulk's Play

**As Mir Bakshi (commander-in-chief):**
- Asked for **Maratha help**
- "Kick out the Jats"
- "Kick out Surajmal Jat"

---

## The Siege Begins

### January 20, 1754

**The arrival:**
- **Raghunath Rao** reached **Kumbher Fort**
- This is Surajmal Jat's stronghold
- Near Agra
- Battle is about to unfold with the Jats

**The stage is set for the tragedy that will unfold at Kumbher Fort...**

## Critical Insights

### The Technology Trap

**The paradox:**
- Got the best technology (French cannons)
- But lacked the **culture** to use it properly
- Maratha warriors = individual heroes
- European warfare = collective discipline
- Cultural mismatch = disaster waiting to happen

### The Ego Problem

**At Panipat:**
- Individual units wanted credit
- Couldn't stand cannons getting the glory
- Abandoned strategy for personal recognition
- Discipline breakdown = defeat
- **Having the tech ≠ being able to use it**

### The Philosophical Split

**Old guard vs. new tactics:**
- Shivaji doctrine deeply ingrained
- Frontal warfare felt **wrong** to many commanders
- Even senior leaders (Holkar) couldn't accept it
- Army was divided on fundamental strategy
- United force fighting with divided philosophy = weakness

### The Political Calculation

**Why Sadashiv Rao kept south:**
- Nana Saheb's insecurity
- Fear of being overshadowed
- Succession concerns for his son
- Better to keep powerful cousin on short leash
- But this meant less experienced commander went north initially

### The Jat Wild Card

**Surajmal Jat:**
- Shrewd, experienced
- Had good fortifications
- Warrior community backing him
- Not to be underestimated
- His decision to side with Safdar Jang = sealed his fate

---

*The Marathas had the best cannons money could buy, but they were still fighting with the heart of guerrilla warriors. They had the technology of the future but the mindset of the past. Individual glory mattered more than collective victory. And at Kumbher Fort, this clash of old and new was about to write a tragedy that would echo all the way to Panipat.*
