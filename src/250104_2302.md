- Very modest beginnings
- No royal lineage

**His Achievement:**

**His Network:**
- Knew all the major players in northern India

- Assistance with local politics

---

## The Strategic Position: Doab Encampment

### Where Abdali Camped

**The Location:**
> "With his huge army he had camped out in the Doab - the region between Ganga and Yamuna"

**Why This Location:**
- Very fertile flat land
- Between two major rivers
- Strategic position
- Control of the heartland

### His Resource Situation

**Financial Backing:**
- **Access to funds** secured
- Allies made sure he was fully satisfied
- "Raring to go"

**Who Provided Support:**
1. **Najib Khan** - just one of several Rohilla commanders
2. **Other Rohilla commanders** supporting him
3. **The Mughal Emperor himself** - Abdali could extract tribute from him

**The Power Dynamic:**
> "He could make him pay up"
- Mughal Emperor forced to fund Abdali
- No choice but to comply

---

## The Alliance Race Begins

### Why Everyone Needed Allies

**Abdali's Awareness:**
- Knew he'd get resistance from Marathas coming from south
- Started making new allies proactively
- "Everybody was hunting for new allies"
- Only way they could win

### Why This Contest Was Inevitable

**The Clash of Interests:**

*Abdali's Motivation:*
- India has wealth and supplies
- He needs them to rule his own country
- Finds prosperity in India

*Maratha Motivation:*
- Want to overlord northern parts of India
- That's where the prosperity is
- Can't tolerate Abdali's presence
- Already made Mughal Emperor a namesake personality
- Were the real power behind the throne

**The Contest:**
> "That was the contest that was now going to take place"

---

## Why Allies Were Critical: The Logistics

### The Massive Armies

**The Scale:**
- When Sadashiv Rao started from Patadur
- Army plus civilians = **like a small town on the move**
- At least **100,000+ people**
- Some say **150,000 people**

**The Breakdown:**
- Army size: 60,000-70,000 when starting
- Started at 50,000-60,000 from Patadur
- As he went north, others joined
- Army kept swelling

**Same for Abdali:**
- He also had massive forces
- Also like a small town constantly moving

### The Resource Requirements

**What Massive Armies Need:**
1. **Supplies for animals** - horses, elephants, etc.
2. **Food for men** - hundreds of thousands of meals daily
3. **Salaries** - men must be paid
4. **Ammunition** - cannonballs, musket balls, gunpowder
5. **Continuous resupply** - can't carry everything

**The Solution:**
> "You need allies because... it's a huge requirement"

- Allies provide local supplies
- Allies provide local funds
- Allies provide local intelligence
- Can't sustain these armies without local support

---

## Abdali's Messenger Strategy

### The Diplomatic Campaign

**What He Did:**
- Sent messengers to different kingdoms
- To their rulers
- Making the case for funds

### The Religious Appeal (to Muslim Rulers)

**The Argument to Rohillas/Mughals:**
> "Islam is in danger! Marathas are going to take over northern India and for that you need me."

**The Ideological Plea:**
- Made it about religion
- About protecting Muslim interests
- "You need to pay up"
- "Otherwise how am I going to win this battle?"
- "Send me resources"

---

## The Rajput Strategy

### Why Rajputs Would Listen

**Their Frustration:**
- **Tired of Maratha harassment**
- Constant tribute demands
- Being bossed around by Marathas
- "They didn't have much to lose"

**Their Position:**
> "Marathas are good but they should stay well south of Narmada. They shouldn't come into Rajasthan."

- Don't want Marathas in their territory
- Tired of being threatened with tributes
- Open to alternatives

---

## The Fence-Sitters

### Why They Hesitated

**The Dilemma:**
- All these powers were **sitting on the fence**
- Didn't want to back the loser
- Didn't know how this battle would go

**The Calculation:**

*If they back Abdali and Marathas win:*
- Marathas will be the victors
- Won't look favorably upon them
- Will face Maratha revenge

*If they back Marathas and Abdali wins:*
- Abdali will create trouble for them
- Will face Afghan revenge

**The Problem:**
> "They were in a troublesome situation"

---

## The Weakness of Rajputs & Others

### Why They Had Limited Options

**The Rajputs:**
- By this time had **lost their relevance**
- Divided into smaller kingdoms in Rajasthan
- No longer a unified power
- Can't stand alone

**Suraj Mal:**
- Also a **small-time player**
- Afraid of Maratha power
- Didn't want Marathas dabbling in northern politics
- "His domain as he saw it"
- But not strong enough to enforce this alone

---

## Najib Khan's Desperation

### Why He Couldn't Let Abdali Leave

**The Reality:**
> "Najib Khan and all that they knew that either way they will be in trouble with Marathas."

**Whether They Win or Lose:**
- Already in trouble with Marathas
- But if Marathas win **with Abdali** → in big trouble
- Then stuck with "800 pound gorilla"

**The Plea:**
> "Don't ever think of going back unless you deal with Marathas and basically get rid of this threat for us. Otherwise we won't let you go."

**Why:**
> "If you go, what will happen to us? That was the biggest issue."

### Najib Khan's Personal Stakes

**His Ambitions:**
- Wanted to be the **Wazir himself**
- In **Delhi**
- Most prestigious position

**His Problem:**
- Rohilla army not that big
- Can't threaten Mughal Emperor alone
- As long as Marathas around, they'd never let him be Wazir

**His Solution:**
- Ask Abdali to plead his case to Mughal Emperor
- Maybe that would be honored
- Because "you can't say no to Abdali that easily"
- "He will extract a high price"
- Abdali can negotiate on Najib's behalf

**The Stakes:**
> "If Abdali goes without resolving this Maratha power, he may lose his kingdom. Not only that, he will lose his life and the whole Rohillas would be in deep trouble."

**Why:**
- They were basically **opportunists**
- No legitimate claim to power
- Dependent on force and Abdali's backing

---

## The First Target: Ahmad Khan Bangash

### Who Was Ahmad Khan Bangash?

**His Position:**
- **Farukhabad** - sultan/nawab
- Small-time ruler
- Allied with the Mughals

**The Changing Dynamic:**
- In the past, under powerful emperors like Aurangzeb
- These rulers reported directly to emperor
- Were **vasal kings**

**The New Reality:**
- Mughal Emperor now weak
- These vassals started behaving **semi-independently**
- "Testing the waters"
- Trying to be separate from Mughal Emperor
- "New found freedom"

---

## Bangash's Background & Allegiance Switches

### His Ethnicity

**Who He Was:**
- **Pathan** - a tribe in Afghanistan
- Proper Afghan
- **Pashtun** = Pathan (same thing)
- "Very proud Afghan people"

**Tribal Context:**
- Pashtun is one tribe among several in Afghanistan
- One of the **dominant tribes**
- Sense of ethnic identity and pride

### His Physical Condition

**The Injury:**
- Had hurt his leg in some battle
- Walked with a limp
- "Kind of crippled"
- Wouldn't walk properly

### His Position at This Time

**Current Title:**
- **Mir Bakshi** at the time
- Got rewarded with this position

**His Previous Alliance:**
- Had switched to Mughal side earlier
- But now Abdali is here
- Time to switch back
- "His loyalty was based on his ethnicity to a certain extent"

**The Pattern:**
> "Switching alliance depending on the situation - whoever is strong at the time"

**The Ethnic Bond:**
- Considered himself Pathan
- Abdali also belonged to Pashtun tribe
- Some sub-tribal connection
- "Semblance of similarity"
- Would consider each other based on nationality and tribe

---

## Bangash's Ambitions

### What He Wanted

**The Allahabad Prize:**
> "He desired very much to take Allahabad or nearby areas under his control from Suja-ud-Daula"

**What Is Allahabad/Prayagraj:**
- **Confluence of three rivers:** Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati
- Saraswati now underground
- Also called **Prayagraj**

### Why Allahabad Was Valuable

**The Holy Site Factor:**
- Considered holy place for Hindus
- Where three rivers meet
- Sweet water abundant
- Provided for agriculture
- Sustained life

**The Economics:**
> "In the olden times if they considered something to be more valuable and life-sustaining, they called it holy."

**Why "Holy":**
- Not necessarily magical power
- But sustains life
- Without water, what do you do?
- Sweet water = agriculture = prosperity

**Example:** 
- Cow is holy animal because it sustained life
- In days when agriculture was weak
- Cow would graze and give milk
- That's your food
- Don't kill the animal that gives you food
- Give it status of holiness → nobody kills it
- Don't need laws or regulations
- Just make it holy

### The Commercial Value

**Why Bangash Wanted It:**
- Several temples there
- Lots of Hindus visit
- Lots of commerce
- Rich traders
- Farmers are rich (fertile land with sweet water)
- **Economy was very good**
- **Can tax people** - they'll pay because well-off
- "That is always attraction for a ruler"

**Current Control:**
- Part of **Suja-ud-Daula's Awadh** territory
- Bangash wanted to snatch it away

---

## The Letter-Writing Strategy

### Abdali's Wazir: Shah Wali Khan

**Who He Was:**
- Wazir = Prime Minister
- Like Mughals had important wazir
- Abdali also had one

**His Suggestion:**
> "Abdali himself should write a letter"

**Why:**
- Carries more weight
- Even if messenger carries the letter
- "It's from Abdali" → more weight
- Difficult to say no to the all-powerful man

---

## The Letters: Two for One

### Letter #1: Abdali's Personal Letter

**The Praise Strategy:**
> "Once you praise him, it is likely that you can bring him on your side. That's why he was praising him very generously in his letter."

**The Metaphor:**
> "It's like if you were to take flowers and throw it on somebody - the guy feels good, right?"

- Spread flowers of praise via letter
- Lots of good, praiseworthy words
- Toward Mr. Bangash

#### The Content of Abdali's Letter

**The Praise:**
> "My wazir told me that you are very trustworthy and you are utilitarian - you are very useful and we value that trait in you."

- Very good at accomplishing big goals
- That's your capacity
- That's why I'm signing this letter myself
- A big man like you should trust me
- I'm in awe of your capability

**The Afghan Pride Appeal:**
> "My kingdom in Afghanistan - my empire - should be a proud thing for every Afghan personality."

- Reminding Bangash: you are also Afghan
- You should be proud of what I've accomplished
- Unifying Afghanistan

**The Trust Declaration:**
> "You are one of my prime commanders and we have tremendous trust in you."

- Trying to butter him up
- Support me

**The Promises:**
- "We will always hold you in high esteem"
- "We'll place you in a great position"
- Buttering him up as much as possible

**The Assurance:**
- Anyone who visits Abdali gets honors
- Given lots of pomp and circumstance
- "If you come and visit, good things will follow"

**The Enticement:**
> "If you come to meet with Abdali, you will profit or benefit like nobody else in Hindustan."

**The Political Alliance:**
- Whatever areas you control - that's fine
- But you should also add new areas to your kingdom
- "The politics of India - you will be able to decide"
- **"Whoever is your enemy is also our enemy"**
- **"Our armies will be one"**

> "Your enemy is my enemy. I will fight for you or make sure your enemies are weakened."

---

### Letter #2: The Wazir's Letter

**Shah Wali Khan Also Wrote:**
- Abdali wasn't the only one writing
- Wazir wrote too
- **Two letters for one person**
- "Two for one"

**The Strategy:**
- Double the pressure
- Double the flattery
- Show how seriously they take Bangash
- Both the king and the prime minister writing

## Major Themes

### 1. The Alliance Race
Both sides desperately seeking allies. Abdali proactively courting local rulers before Marathas can secure them.

### 2. The Flattery Offensive
"Throw flowers on somebody and they feel good" - Abdali using lavish praise as a weapon.

### 3. Ethnic/Religious Bonds
Appeals to shared Afghan identity (Pathan/Pashtun), shared Muslim faith. Bonds that transcend immediate political interests.

### 4. The Fence-Sitter's Dilemma
Small rulers caught between two superpowers. Don't want to back the loser. Paralyzed by fear of choosing wrong side.

### 5. Logistics = Everything
Massive armies need local allies for supplies, funds, food. Can't sustain 100,000+ people without local support.

### 6. The Ideological Card
To Muslims: "Islam is in danger." To Afghans: "Afghan pride." To Rajputs: "Get rid of Maratha harassment." Tailored messages.

### 7. Opportunism & Survival
Najib Khan, Bangash, and others switching sides based on who's stronger. No deep loyalty - just survival.

---

## Strategic Analysis

### Why Abdali Was Ahead in Alliance Race

**His Advantages:**
1. **Personal touch** - Wrote letters himself (rare for a king)
2. **Double pressure** - King + Wazir both writing
3. **Concrete promises** - "We'll make you powerful"
4. **Enemy identification** - "Your enemy is my enemy"
5. **Ethnic bonds** - Afghan to Afghan appeal
6. **Religious appeal** - Islam in danger narrative
7. **Already powerful** - Can extract tribute from Mughal Emperor himself

### Why Marathas Were Behind

**Their Disadvantages:**
1. **Seen as outsiders** - From the Deccan
2. **Reputation as tax collectors** - Constant tribute demands
3. **Just harassment** - No concrete benefits offered
4. **Bhau inexperienced** - First time in north, doesn't know politics
5. **Fighting uphill** - Have to overcome years of resentment

---

## The Desperation Hierarchy

### Most Desperate: Najib Khan
- Will lose life and kingdom if Abdali leaves
- Absolutely cannot let Abdali go back
- "Won't let you go"
- His entire survival depends on Abdali destroying Marathas

### Very Desperate: Ahmad Khan Bangash
- Wants Allahabad badly
- Sees opportunity with Abdali here
- His threat has "waned" - no longer as powerful
- Needs external help to achieve ambitions

### Somewhat Desperate: Rajputs
- Lost their relevance
- Divided into small kingdoms
- Tired of Maratha harassment
- But afraid to commit to either side

### Least Desperate: Suja-ud-Daula
- Actually has significant power (controls Awadh)
- Sitting on fence because he can
- Both sides courting him
- Can afford to wait and see

---

## The Economics of Holiness

**Fascinating Insight:**
> "In the olden times if they considered something to be more valuable and life-sustaining, they called it holy."

**Examples:**

*The Cow:*
- Grazes → gives milk → sustains human life
- Don't kill your food source
- Make it "holy" → nobody kills it
- No need for laws or regulations
- Just make it holy

*Three Rivers Meeting:*
- Sweet water = agriculture = prosperity = life
- Becomes "holy" site
- Not magical, but practical
- Sustains life

**The Strategy:**
- Call it holy → people protect it naturally
- More effective than laws
- Deep cultural programming

---

## The Letters' Effectiveness

### Why They Might Work on Bangash

1. **Personal from the King** - Shows respect
2. **Flattery** - Everyone likes praise
3. **Ethnic bond** - Afghan to Afghan
4. **Concrete promises** - Position, power, help against enemies
5. **United armies** - "Our armies will be one"
6. **Benefit pitch** - "Profit like nobody else in Hindustan"
7. **Pride appeal** - Afghan empire to be proud of

### The Risk for Bangash

**If he joins Abdali and Marathas win:**
- Face Maratha revenge
- Lose everything

**But if he doesn't join and Abdali wins:**
- Miss the opportunity
- Someone else will get the benefits
- Might face Abdali's displeasure

---

## What's Coming

**Immediate:**
- Will Bangash accept?
- What will Suja-ud-Daula do?
- Can Marathas counter Abdali's alliance offensive?

**The Stakes:**
- Whoever wins the alliance race has huge advantage
- Locals provide supplies, intelligence, safe passage
- Without allies, can't sustain massive armies
- The battle might be decided before armies even meet

---

**Where we left off:** Abdali and his wazir have sent flattering letters to Bangash. The "flowers of praise" have been thrown. The promises made. The ethnic bonds invoked. Now the question: Will it work?

---

*Abdali isn't just bringing an army - he's bringing a diplomatic offensive. Letters, flattery, promises, ethnic appeals, religious appeals, concrete benefits. He's playing the alliance game at the highest level. Meanwhile, Bhau is still learning the basics of northern politics. The race is on.*
