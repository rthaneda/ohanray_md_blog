- Asking them to **send him money**

### Suraj Mal's Defiant Response

**What He Wrote Back:**
> "Abdali first needs to drive away the Marathas and show he was the master before they could accept being his vassals."

**The Message:**
- Show you're **actually in charge**
- **Defeat the Marathas** first
- Then we'll pay
- Not before

---

## Why Abdali Considers Leaving

### The Economic Reality

**The Problem:**
- Delhi had been **looted just two years earlier**
- **Nothing to interest Abdali** there
- His **instincts** told him to **return to Afghanistan**

---

## Najib Khan Convinces Him to Stay

### The Persuasion

**What Najib Said:**
- **Urged him to stay**
- **Marathas would return** as they had in 1757
- If you leave now = they come back
- All this for nothing

**The Result:**
- Abdali decides to stay

---

## The Unprecedented Decision

### Staying Through Summer (First Time Since 1748)

**The Historic Choice:**
> "For the first time since he invaded India in 1748, Abdali decided to stay in India in the summer months."

**Why This Is Big:**
- **Afghan army not going to be happy**
- First and foremost: **Don't want to stay in India** too long
- Come basically to **loot**
- Abdali allows them some looting for personal purpose
- Most loot he keeps for himself

### Problem #1: Nothing to Loot

**The Reality:**
- That is number one: **Nothing to loot now**
- Delhi already looted
- Not much left

### Problem #2: The Heat

**The Most Important Reason:**
> "In the summer months, India gets very hot. The northern plains and Afghan troops are not used to those temperatures."

**The Afghan Reaction:**
- **Very unhappy**
- Want to: **Come, loot, take money, go back**
- **Nothing to be had** in India in summer for them

**Why Stay Then:**
- **Less to loot** this time
- Just been looted
- Not like last time (lots to take)
- But **Najib Khan stopped him** from going back
- Saying: "Don't go unless you have **tangled with Maratha army**"
- "**Finish them off** so that I am safe here"

**Otherwise:**
- Nothing accomplished
- He's at **mercy of Marathas** again

---

## Hingani's Report (February 1, 1760)

### The Letter from the North

**What He Wrote:**
> "God has been kind. We ran for 20 coasts and reached Patawadi. Left all our treasure in baggage and traveling day and night reached Kotputli. Malhar Ji Holkar has come and was stunned seeing the state of the army of Shinde."

**The Assessment:**
> "Now he is planning his moves. Abdali is moving against the Jat. He has an army of 80,000. The army over here is trembling like a cane."

**Holkar's Force:**
> "Holkar has 7 or 8,000 good troops with him. Nobody dares to confront Abdali openly. Wherever they [Marathas] run, Abdali follows."

**Abdali's Plan:**
> "Abdali's plan is to unite Madho Singh, Awadh's ruler and the Jat and cross the Chambar and come to Ujjain."

**Geography Note:**
- Ujjain = just south of Chambar river

---

## Why Holkar Won't Fight

### The Reasons Explained

**Problem #1: Outnumbered:**
- Holkar has **7-8,000**
- Abdali has **80,000**
- **Outnumbered 10 to 1**

**Problem #2: Fighting Style:**
- Doesn't believe in **frontal warfare**
- Doesn't want to do it **open that way**

**Problem #3: Knows Abdali's Strength:**
- Seen it in action
- At least heard **first-hand accounts**
- Knows needs **much bigger army**

---

## Malhar Rao Holkar: Now the Tallest Leader

### The New Reality

**His Position:**
> "Malhar Rao Holkar, now the tallest Maratha leader in the north, had to restore the confidence of the armies at Kutli."

**The Situation:**
- Shinde army was **panic stricken**
- After short battle at Burari Ghat
- Death of Dattaji
- **Jankoji injured** (bullet wound in arm)

---

## Holkar's Counter-Attack Plans (Late January 1760)

### Planning the Response

**Who Plans:**
- **Malhar Rao**
- **Gangadhar Tatya** (his chief aide)
- Planned **counter attack** with their **smaller army**

### The Movement

**January 23, 1760:**
- Malhar Rao started from **Kutli**
- **Two weeks** after Dattaji's death
- Moved to **Kanaud** (present day Mahendragarh)
- In **Mewat Territory** southwest of Delhi

**The Strategy:**
- **Lay in wait**
- Looking for which way Afghans moved

---

## Abdali Moves Against the Jats (January 27, 1760)

### The Campaign

**January 27, 1760:**
- Abdali moved from outskirts of Delhi
- **Against the Jats**
- Left for **Shergarh near Mathura**

**February 4, 1760:**
- Laid **siege to Surajmal's fort at Dig**

**The Plan:**
- Then planned to head for **Jaipur**
- To obtain **funds from Madho Singh**

**The Change:**
- But on hearing Malhar Rao in **Mewat Territory** near Delhi
- **Headed in that direction**

---

## Holkar's Movements (February 1760)

### The Cat and Mouse Game

**February 22:**
- Malhar Rao moved to **Bahadurgarh** west of Delhi
- Then to outskirts of Delhi
- At **Kalka Devi temple**

**February 28:**
- From here **crossed the Yamuna**
- Headed for **Sikandarabad**

**The Direction:**
- Crossed from **west bank to east bank**
- Exactly what **Dattaji had done** month and half earlier
- And **died in battle**
- Except now **crossed with no one there**

**Clarification:**
- Dattaji died at **Burarighat** on western coast of Yamuna
- In middle (island formed)
- Not necessarily crossing
- Just fighting from western direction

---

## Abdali Sends Jahan Khan (Late February 1760)

### The Pursuit

**What Happened:**
- Abdali hearing of Holkar's **proximity to Delhi**
- **Headed for capital**
- Sent his general **Jahan Khan**
- Across Yamuna after Holkar
- With **large army**
- **Chased him**

---

## The Reports to Peshwa (March 1, 1760)

### Gangadhar Tatya's Letter

**March 1:**
> "We will go to the Rohila territory soon. The Gilcha's move will be known soon. By some measure we have to instill fear in Gilcha. So our troops become like lions."

**Note:**
- **Gilcha** = Afghan troops with Abdali
- **Rohilas** = Afghan soldiers who settled in India (under Najib)

### Raja Keshav Rao's Letter

**March 1, 1760:**
> "Holkar and Jankoji are in Narnal district and Abdali, Najib Khan and Dunde Khan Rohila with a large force and heavy baggage in Alawar district."

**The Economic Warfare:**
> "Holkar is cutting off supplies to Abdali's army and prices are high in his camp."

**The Demands:**
> "Abdali has demanded payment from Madho Singh and Surajmal and promised to expel the Marathas to the south."

**The Responses:**
> "However, Surajmal has replied that he should first take the throne, properly deal with the Marathas and then he will pay. Madho Singh has given a like reply."

**The Strategy:**
- Both saying: "**We'll pay you later**"
- Will **assess which is stronger side**
- Before extending support
- **Smart**

**Why:**
- If Marathas come back after they paid
- Marathas will **finish off** the other troops
- They'll have **lost everything**
- So: "You **deal with Marathas**"

**The Benefit:**
- If they fight each other
- Come out **weaker**
- Benefits **smaller parties** (Rajputs, Suraj Mal Jat)
- Good if they **stay out** of big conflicts

**The Other Demands:**
> "Abdali has called the absentee emperor Shah Alam II and Shuja Uddawla and asked them for money. Let us see whether they come."

---

## Holkar's Strategy (March 1760)

### Over a Month of Maneuvering

**The Reality:**
> "Over a month had passed since both Abdali and Malhar Rao had been moving in the vicinity of Delhi."

**Holkar's Approach:**
- Intent on **avoiding open conflict**
- With his **smaller force**
- Relied on **quick movements**

**The Plan:**
- Confident of being able to **attack Rohila homeland**
- Creating **diversion** for Abdali's allies
- By attacking **Najib's land** where Rohilas live
- Can maybe **break up their coalition**

---

## The Sikandarabad Action (March 1760)

### The Raid

**What Holkar Did:**
- At Sikandarabad
- **Thoroughly looted the city**
- Left his army with Diwan **Gangadhar Tatya**
- Moved on towards **Anupshah**

**The Goal:**
- To **cross the Ganga**
- Enter the **Rohila territory**

**The Result:**
- He **did cross**

---

## The Decision: Who Goes North?

### The Three Commanders Discussed

**The Options:**
1. **Raghunath Rao** - Brother of Peshwa
2. **Sadashiv Rao Bhau** - Cousin of Peshwa  
3. **Vishwas Rao** - Son of Peshwa

---

## Raghunath Rao: The Experienced One

### His Advantages

**What He Knows:**
- Knows the **lay of the land**
- **What is what**
- **Politics of north**
- Been there before
- Knows players

**Unlike Bhau:**
- Bhau had **never been to the north**
- This would be **big reason** (for problems later)
- Not just that they lost battle
- This would be major factor

---

## Vishwas Rao: The Young Heir

### Who He Is

**The Basics:**
- **Son of Nana Saheb Peshwa**
- **19 years old**
- Young and **inexperienced**

### Why Send Him: Official Reason

**The Purpose:**
- To **maintain prestige of Peshwa**
- Not just prestige

**The Real Reason:**
> "Vishwas Rao in the eyes of his father, Nana Saheb, he will be the next Peshwa."

**The Training:**
- Has to **gain experience** of actual warfare
- In those days, Peshwa or people who would be kings
- Had to have **actual warfare experience**
- **Otherwise unqualified**

**The Decision:**
- Vishwas Rao going
- Has to gain experience
- Under **leadership of Sadashiv**
- Because Sadashiv Rao was **experienced commander**

---

## The Hidden Motive: Nanasaheb's Self-Preservation

### The Real Question

**What Nanasaheb Thought:**
> "If you are Nana Saheb, what would you have in your mind?"

**The Answer:**
- "I wouldn't want my **cousin to get all the credit**"

**Exactly:**
> "Nana Saheb has this thought in his mind of self preservation."

**The Fear:**
- If Bhau is **big hero**
- He comes back having won
- He can say: "**I am the Peshwa**"
- **He will be**

**Why:**
- This was **biggest ever invasion**
- If he defeats Abdali = **tremendous accomplishment**
- Since maybe **Aurangzeb**, no one such a big threat
- **Fight of their lives**

**The Threat:**
> "Then Sadashiv Rao would be at the very top of the list to be [Peshwa]."

---

## The Solution: Shared Credit

### The Arrangement

**What Nanasaheb Wants:**
- That **credit to be shared** with Vishwas Rao
- And by extension **himself** kind of

**The Structure:**
- When force goes north (huge force)
- **Head of campaign** was Vishwas Rao
- **Officially**

**The Reality:**
- **Actual strategies** and implementation
- To be done by **Sadashiv**

**The Result:**
- Credit will **definitely go to Vishwas Rao**
- Because he's the **Senapati**
- Representative in north

**The Claim:**
- Can claim: "My son got experience"
- "Plus he won the campaign"
- "He's the big boss"

---

## The Army's Confidence (Departure)

### High Spirits

**When They Left:**
- Confidence **extremely high**
- **Pumped up**
- "We're going to **smash these people**"

**Why:**
- Had **best of warriors**
- Had **artillery**
- **French trained people**
- **Thousand of them**
- **Ibrahim Khan** chief of artillery
- Leading them

**The Technology:**
- **Tremendous confidence** we'll win
- Artillery able to deliver shells
- **One to two miles**
- Depending on how you send them
- **Extremely high spirits**

## Critical Insights

### The Summer Decision: Unprecedented

**Why It Matters:**
- **First time in 12 years**
- Since 1748 first invasion
- Always left before summer
- Afghan army **hates** Indian heat

**The Implications:**
- Shows **commitment** to destroying Marathas
- Not just raiding anymore
- **Strategic shift**
- Willing to suffer for goal

**The Risk:**
- Army unhappy
- Nothing to loot
- Heat unbearable
- **Morale problems** coming

### Najib's Influence

**The Power:**
- **Convinced** Abdali to stay
- Against his instincts
- Against economic sense
- Against Afghan army's wishes

**Why It Worked:**
- Najib's **local perspective**
- If Abdali leaves = Marathas return
- Najib **at their mercy**
- All this for nothing
- Must **finish the job**

**The Relationship:**
- Abdali **trusts** Najib
- Relies on his **local knowledge**
- Najib = **boots on ground**
- Symbiotic relationship

### The Economic Stalemate

**Nobody Paying:**
- Suraj Mal: "Win first, then I'll pay"
- Madho Singh: Same response
- Shah Alam II: Called but may not come
- Shuja Uddawla: Called but may not come

**The Strategy:**
- **Sitting on fence**
- See who wins
- Then support winner
- **Smart politics**

**The Problem for Abdali:**
- Came for money
- Not getting money
- Staying costs money
- **Running out** of funds
- Summer = expensive

### Holkar's Guerrilla Campaign

**The Tactics:**
- **Avoiding open battle**
- Quick movements
- **Cutting supply lines**
- Raiding cities
- Attacking Rohila homeland

**Why It Works:**
- Can't catch him
- Smaller, more mobile
- Knows terrain
- **Frustrating** Abdali

**The Limit:**
- Can **harass** but not **defeat**
- Can't drive them out
- Just **buying time**
- Until main army arrives

### The Vishwas Rao Decision: Politics Over Strategy

**The Military Logic:**
- Send **Raghunath Rao** (experienced)
- Or send **Bhau** (proved himself)
- Don't send **19-year-old**

**The Political Logic:**
- Must send heir
- For **experience**
- For **legitimacy**
- For **credit**

**The Hidden Logic:**
- **Self-preservation**
- Can't let cousin get **all glory**
- Must **share credit**
- Protect succession

**The Structure:**
- Vishwas Rao = **official head**
- Bhau = **actual commander**
- **Confused** command structure
- Who's really in charge?

### The Self-Preservation Instinct

**Nanasaheb's Fear:**
- Bhau defeats Abdali alone
- **Biggest accomplishment** in generation
- Can claim Peshwa-ship
- **Threatens** Nanasaheb's son

**The Solution:**
- Send son **along with** cousin
- Son gets **official credit**
- Even if Bhau does work
- **Secures** succession

**The Problem:**
- **Divided command**
- Confused authority
- Political consideration > military necessity
- **Will cause issues**

### The Confidence Gap

**The Maratha Army:**
- **Extremely high spirits**
- Best warriors
- French artillery
- Ibrahim Khan
- "Going to **smash** them"

**The Reality Check:**
- Abdali has **80,000**
- Abdali has **experience**
- Abdali has **allies**
- Abdali has **political skill**
- Abdali staying **through summer** (committed)

**The Disconnect:**
- Confidence ≠ readiness
- Technology ≠ victory
- **Overconfidence** dangerous

### The Age Dynamic

**All Young:**
- Abdali: 35
- Bhau: 29
- Vishwas Rao: 19

**What This Means:**
- **Pride** matters more
- **Honor** over pragmatism
- **Less patience** in negotiations
- More likely to **fight than compromise**
- **Ego clashes** likely

**The Exception:**
- Holkar: 50s
- **More cautious**
- **Won't fight openly**
- **Survival** over glory
- But sidelined

### The Two-Month Stalemate

**February-March:**
- Holkar and Abdali **circling**
- Near Delhi
- Neither engaging
- Just **maneuvering**

**What It Shows:**
- **Waiting** for main Maratha army
- Real battle **not yet**
- This is **preliminaries**
- **Buying time**

**The Stakes:**
- Every day Abdali stays = **costs money**
- Every day Holkar survives = **preserves force**
- Every day = main army **getting closer**

---

## What's Coming

**The Setup:**
- Abdali committed (staying summer)
- Holkar maneuvering (can't engage)
- Bhau + Vishwas Rao coming north
- **Divided command** structure
- **High confidence**
- French artillery

**The Problems:**
- Vishwas Rao = inexperienced
- Bhau = doesn't know northern politics
- Nanasaheb = more concerned with credit than victory
- Cavalry = still indisciplined
- **Political considerations** > military strategy

**The Opposition:**
- Abdali = **committed**
- Not leaving
- Will **finish the job**
- Has political allies
- Strategic genius

**The Question:**
- Will divided command work?
- Can they coordinate?
- Will politics doom them?
- Is confidence justified?

---

**February-March 1760: For the first time in twelve years, Abdali decides to stay through the Indian summer. His army hates it. There's nothing left to loot. The heat is unbearable. But Najib convinces him: if you leave, the Marathas return. Finish the job. Meanwhile, Suraj Mal and Madho Singh tell him the same thing: win first, then we'll pay. Not before. Everyone's hedging their bets. Holkar's playing cat and mouse near Delhi, raiding cities, cutting supply lines, but he can't actually fight. He's outnumbered 10 to 1. He's just buying time. And in Pune, the decision is made: Sadashiv Rao Bhau will lead the campaign. But so will Vishwas Rao. Officially. Because Nanasaheb can't let his cousin take all the credit. Can't let him become the hero who defeated Abdali. So his 19-year-old son must share the glory. Divided command. Political considerations over military necessity. But the army is pumped. They have French cannons. They have Ibrahim Khan. They're going to smash these people. Right? Confidence is extremely high. As they march north toward a confrontation that will determine the fate of India.**
