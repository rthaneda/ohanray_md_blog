## Bahu's Strategic Letter (October 14)

**The Recipient:**
- Govind Pan Bundela (Maratha commander in Bundelkhand)
- Letters serve as strategic instructions
- Reveal Bahu's thinking and plans

**Letter Content: The Kunjapura Decision**

**Why Go to Kunjapura?**
- "No point waiting for Yamuna to cross"
- "Crossing won't happen quickly"
- "Better to go to Kunjapura and destroy Abdul Samad Khan there"
- **Pre-emptive strike before enemy can consolidate**

**The Strategic Logic:**
- Abdul Samad Khan waiting in Kunjapura to cross Yamuna
- If he crosses and joins Abdali: Becomes more threat
- If attacked now in fort: Easier to eliminate
- **Destroy enemy before they strengthen**

**The Timeline:**
- "Will be back from Kunjapura in 8-15 days"
- Expected quick campaign
- Get supplies and troops
- Return to Delhi area
- Wait for Yamuna to recede
- Then engage Abdali in battle

## Political Reassurance Campaign in Delhi

**Installing the Emperor:**
- Sent Nana Purandare and Jadhav to Delhi
- Mission: Install new crown prince
- Mission: Declare return of real emperor
- Create legitimacy for Maratha-backed rule

**Coins as Political Statement:**
- "Fabricated coins in the name of this blinded emperor"
- Coins had Shah Alam's name (the blinded emperor)
- **Striking coins = official recognition of legitimacy**
- Says: "This is our emperor, we back him"

**Public Announcement:**
- "People went around Delhi announcing his return"
- "Everybody is happy with announcement"
- **Propaganda campaign for political legitimacy**
- Trying to prove Marathas respect Mughal system

## The Yamuna Problem: Timing Assumption

**Bahu's Prediction:**
- "Yamuna water will take about a month to recede"
- This is mid-October estimate
- So roughly end of October/early November for crossing
- **All planning based on this 1-month assumption**

**The Reality:**
- Hastanakshatra (celestial period) = heavy rains
- "Tremendous rain" causing rivers to flood
- "Rivers flooded beyond imagination"
- "Water not receding" despite some clear days
- **Monsoon dynamics uncertain and unpredictable**

**The Difference of Opinion:**
- Mehendale (another commander) thought differently
- "Different take on when Yamuna would recede"
- Unknown if they discussed it
- But Bahu sticking with 1-month estimate
- **Later Mehendale will prove right, Bahu wrong**

---

## The Money Crisis (Still Ongoing)

**From October 14 Letter:**
- "We are not getting any loan"
- Same money problems as before
- Still need to pay salaries
- Still need to buy groceries
- **Supply crisis unresolved despite Delhi capture**

**Why Kunjapura Matters:**
- "Kunjapura is flush with supplies and money"
- News of stored wealth reached Bahu
- Running short himself
- **This is desperation + opportunity meeting**

---

## The Boundary Negotiations: Complete Deadlock

**The Fundamental Problem:**
- No common ground between sides
- "No agreeing, no common point"
- "Bridge so big there was no way for compromise"
- **Negotiations are theater, not genuine**

**The Greedy Afghans:**
- "Patans are not sincere, they have become greedy"
- Asking boundary at Sirhind (too far south)
- Want to meddle in Delhi affairs
- **Can't satisfy their demands**

**Why Battle is Inevitable:**
- No negotiated settlement possible
- No compromise point exists
- Both sides have incompatible demands
- War is the only remaining option

---

## Maratha Morale & Confidence

**The Assessment:**
- "If battle happens, we're in good condition"
- "We are pretty strong"
- "Confident we'll destroy enemy quickly"
- **Despite hunger problems, morale is high**

**The Problems:**
- Hunger issues (both animals and humans)
- Not enough food to eat
- But confidence in victory regardless
- **Emotional/psychological strength despite material weakness**

---

## The Kunjapura Campaign Plan

**The Sequence:**
- October 14: Bahu writes letter announcing plan
- October 16: Bahu arrives at Kunjapura with full army
- Raiding parties (Shinde, Holkar) sent ahead for siege
- Ibrahim Khan following with cannon units

**Abdali's Response:**
- After learning about Bahu's move
- Sends army units to cross Yamuna near Kunjapura
- Trying to reinforce/protect Kunjapura
- Trying to find crossing point

**The Race:**
- Both sides moving toward Kunjapura
- Both trying to control it
- First one there dominates
- Bahu gets there first (October 16)

---

## Ibrahim Khan's Logistics Challenge

**The Problem:**
- Cannons are heavy
- Can't move fast with entire force
- Following behind main army
- Bahu reaches October 16, cannons still coming

**Bahu's Message:**
- "Hurry up, come here quickly"
- Recognizes artillery will be needed
- Battle coming sooner than expected
- **Can't win without cannons**

## Key Strategic Points

**The 1-Month Assumption:**
- Everything planned around Yamuna taking month to cross
- Campaign: 8-15 days at Kunjapura
- Return to Delhi
- Wait for water to recede
- THEN engage Abdali
- **Timing critical to entire strategy**

**The Supply Crisis:**
- Still major problem despite Delhi capture
- Kunjapura supplies are essential lifeline
- Can't sustain 100,000+ people much longer
- **Kunjapura = desperation, not luxury**

**The Political Theater:**
- Coins in emperor's name = legitimacy claim
- Public announcements = propaganda
- Crown prince installation = reassurance
- **But real power is still Maratha guns**

---

**Where We Left Off:** October 16, 1760. Bahu reaches Kunjapura with main army, begins siege. Sends urgent message for Ibrahim Khan and cannons to hurry. Abdali's forces trying to cross Yamuna near Kunjapura to relieve garrison. Race is on to control the fort. Bahu confident about victory but still dealing with hunger/supply problems. Money crisis unresolved. Yamuna expected to take ~1 month to become crossable.

*Bahu was betting everything on time. He thought he had a month. He thought Kunjapura would take 8-15 days. He thought Yamuna would be impassable for weeks. He thought he'd get back to Delhi, resupply, and position perfectly for battle. He was betting on the calendar. But the calendar would betray him.*
